Garrett Laroy Johnson: I have your I believe I have your your information will just double check that before we sign off and i'll send it over to you.

7
00:00:48,810 --> 00:01:11,550
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And videos collected during your interview, as well as photographs of of what you make will be used to inform my dissertation and subsequent publication research, as well as potentially other informal publications and so these these images and videos may appear there.

8
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,680
Garrett Laroy Johnson: There are no foreseeable risks or discomfort to your participation.

10
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:49,650
Garrett Laroy Johnson: cited anonymously Likewise, if you wish for the entirety of your your statements your participation be anonymous indicate that to me, and that will be, it will be so.

11
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:57,600
Garrett Laroy Johnson: that's it that you have any questions about the about the consent or where the materials will be going how they're being used.

12
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,180
sejo: And not, I think it's OK.

13
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,070
Garrett Laroy Johnson: cool OK.

14
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,620
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Alright, so we'll go ahead and get started, then.

15
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:13,320
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So you already have your craft materials, which is great, so we can go ahead and get right into things.

16
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,020
Garrett Laroy Johnson: There will be.

17
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:25,980
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I should know that number, by now, I think, five different sections there'll be either five minutes or 10 minutes.

18
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,890
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And if each of these you'll receive from me a prompt at the beginning and.

19
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:49,500
Garrett Laroy Johnson: After I give the prompts you can ask for clarification and she gets me repeat something we can talk about it a little bit and then i'll go ahead and start a timer, the reason I started timer is just so we can get through all the sections in the amount of time.

20
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,630
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I will give you a one minute warning.

21
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:10,200
Garrett Laroy Johnson: As we get towards the end also if you want me to break up the time differently, like if you have five minutes, and you, you want me to give you like a notification every minute I can do that i'm here to keep time for you, if you want.

22
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:24,060
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Second, is you don't need to use all the time, if you don't want to there's no obligation to use all 10 minutes you can simply say that's it or that's all I have, I think that's what I have and we'll move on.

23
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,860
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Any questions about this bigger form.

24
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:38,700
sejo: And I mean no I mean, I have a question, but I think it will depend on the activity i'm wondering if I mean I mean craig's than I like the idea of having these crafts materials.

25
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,840
sejo: yeah I.

26
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:50,400
sejo: was like I don't know if I mean i'm it's Okay, no but i'm just wondering if it's expected for me to actually also speak or talk about things or not, but i'm i'm okay with this or price.

27
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,720
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay.

28
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,930
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah i'll get i'll get right into that actually.

29
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,460
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And we can definitely talk about that so.

30
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:21,600
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Your first block of time is 10 minutes, and in that i'd like for you to construct a set of props that help you to think through your project that you presented at slo mo co or in your case that was the basis of your micro residency.

31
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:33,810
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You are invited to think aloud as you go as you're making things I think i'll use this because i'm thinking of that.

32
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,680
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So you may speak and make at the same time.

33
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,840
Garrett Laroy Johnson: But if this is something like you know pounding your head and circling you tell me the same time.

34
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,900
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Then don't don't sweat that.

35
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:54,390
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You may think about making a prop and then saying something about it and then making another problem saying something about it or making a bunch of things and then speaking about it.

36
00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:06,120
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So you don't need to stress too much about doing things at the same time, if that's going to impact, you know your your engagement with in some way okay.

37
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,870
Garrett Laroy Johnson: cool do you have any questions about that.

38
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:18,510
sejo: So you said, I mean i'm thinking about it that it's, so I will be making props that will help me talk already helped me like I know like.

39
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:26,670
sejo: convey what I did during that make my Christianity or the process of the micro micro c&c in slo mo.

40
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:36,300
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah and and to that and that when I when I say, I invite you to speak about your project or to talk about and think through your project.

41
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,500
Garrett Laroy Johnson: The props can be things which help you make sense of.

42
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Garrett Laroy Johnson: The project conceptually It can also be technically it can also be socially with regards to other people, it can also be personally and why did why this project now for sale.

43
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:07,830
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I leave that open and so to that end, the way in which you speak about this project may look very different than, say, a conference presentation.

44
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,280
Garrett Laroy Johnson: that's sort of up to you, and how you're feeling today.

45
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,420
sejo: awesome yeah.

46
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:18,330
Garrett Laroy Johnson: cool if you have any other questions i'll go ahead and put 10 on the clock and we can get started.

47
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,580
sejo: I think i'm ready.

48
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:32,790
Garrett Laroy Johnson: let's go.

49
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,630
sejo: I mean, I really like looking I guess.

50
00:06:36,630 --> 00:08:48,660
sejo: it's interesting that at first, I thought about two different aspect, on one hand, I thought about the people that was there in day like in the cohort and stuff like this, so I really making this little people.

51
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:59,190
sejo: I realized that I think a lot of people i'm thinking in terms of not only I want to have the people that were like part of the cohort and then i'm not being met.

52
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,870
sejo: Several times and, ultimately, you know the people that participated in the.

53
00:09:03,870 --> 00:10:41,610
sejo: workshops, I mean, some of them are the same, but there were people that were not in the heart.

54
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,290
sejo: Just in case.

55
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,970
sejo: Five minutes left, please.

56
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,710
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah absolutely.

57
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,070
Garrett Laroy Johnson: you're at five and a half minutes right now i'll tell you five as well.

58
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:58,500
Okay awesome.

59
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:07,590
sejo: So finally i'm thinking in making like these props to talk about being the project 9% of these different.

60
00:11:07,590 --> 00:15:16,200
sejo: symbol.

61
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:46,710
sejo: This little people.

62
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,750
sejo: Okay, yes i'm ready.

63
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,690
Great.

64
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:59,790
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Thank you, is there anything you want to say about these are you you're just you're ready to present them.

65
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:09,810
sejo: As well yeah just as a recap now, so I have like this, and these are the people that were around me and the people that were in the cohort and.

66
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:17,160
sejo: Like helping and and these people, I remember that were participating the workshop so.

67
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,130
sejo: that's I said that I have.

68
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:25,500
sejo: A couple three different sessions, and so I had like this.

69
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,450
sejo: intersection between the groups.

70
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,450
sejo: yeah and also then.

71
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:36,600
sejo: Like these symbols that I was using to represent movements as part of their activity.

72
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,580
Garrett Laroy Johnson: that's great Thank you.

73
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,740
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay.

74
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,870
Garrett Laroy Johnson: This is awesome.

75
00:16:45,870 --> 00:17:01,050
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So, in the next 10 minutes i'll ask you to set aside the props that you've made so far and and now to endeavor to repeat this process.

76
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:16,920
Garrett Laroy Johnson: However, instead of thinking about your own project to to find another project from slum moko that that stuck out to you, for some reason, maybe you're thinking of it, right now, maybe.

77
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:25,890
Garrett Laroy Johnson: We need to go back and look at the proceedings, maybe it's a couple of projects and you want to talk about them in relation to each other that could be okay too.

78
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:37,980
Garrett Laroy Johnson: But otherwise just repeating the process, so making some props that help you think about that project likewise it's not about presenting that project.

79
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:49,500
Garrett Laroy Johnson: authentically, so to speak, or completely, but rather about you know why is it that this project sticks out to you why isn't lingered for you what what what stuck.

80
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,560
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Do you have any questions about that.

81
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,080
sejo: No it's also the Minutes.

82
00:17:55,080 --> 00:22:57,600
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Also 10 minutes yeah yeah cool also give you i'll give you five and i'll give you one minute.

83
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:04,440
sejo: i'm thinking about their project by Alice.

84
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,240
sejo: it's interesting because I don't remember the name but I remember.

85
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,460
sejo: The apology or why they do that how it was.

86
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:22,890
sejo: Never part of these brands like rooms, the rooms that it could be navigating.

87
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:32,190
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You have about five minutes okay.

88
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,960
sejo: We moved.

89
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,670
sejo: Our mouse mice.

90
00:23:38,670 --> 00:25:38,460
sejo: And we were represented us little circles in the space.

91
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,110
sejo: Okay, I think i'm ready.

92
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:50,220
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Great yeah whenever you're ready, you have about two minutes.

93
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,250
sejo: Nothing goes on, it goes.

94
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,610
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, great.

95
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:03,270
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, I don't usually do this, but I really need to run to the restroom so.

96
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,630
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Take a couple minutes yeah and i'll be i'll be right back.

97
00:26:06,630 --> 00:28:31,980
sejo: This is a good.

98
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,100
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay i'm back.

99
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,600
Garrett Laroy Johnson: thanks for your patience.

100
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,370
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, so.

101
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:47,760
Garrett Laroy Johnson: We have now two sets of props.

102
00:28:47,760 --> 00:29:05,010
Garrett Laroy Johnson: In the next block and i'm going to invite you to make a new product or new set of props that connects the props from the first exercise, and the second exercise.

103
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:25,050
Garrett Laroy Johnson: connect can mean like physically and materially putting these things together, it can be creating a prop that conceptually ties us together in some ways, or grounds them together in some ways.

104
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:28,410
Garrett Laroy Johnson: cool yeah do you have any question about that.

105
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,330
sejo: No it's all right.

106
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,940
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, you also have five minutes for this.

107
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:44,790
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, or no now, you will have five minutes for this this your first five minute one i'll give you I can give you just one minute at the end, or it can give you 54321.

108
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,190
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Depending on what you prefer.

109
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,740
sejo: And just the one at the end.

110
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,650
Garrett Laroy Johnson: cool sounds good all right i'll go ahead and get started.

111
00:29:52,650 --> 00:34:33,390
Okay.

112
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:38,310
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay super.

113
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,730
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Do you want to say a little bit about how those are connected.

114
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,200
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Connected props to you.

115
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:49,470
sejo: yeah so one of these, I mean I thought that a.

116
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:59,100
sejo: project with this project we're connected like in terms of what I see me the way I see it in the computational thinking on one hand, like, just like in a very like.

117
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:10,050
sejo: tangible way they were mediated by screens with angular screen, so we were participating in these two worlds beyond this, a rectangle.

118
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,270
sejo: And then.

119
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:29,040
sejo: Well, some of these props and they do that they would sign now that both both have to do with discrete components, on one hand, like they they have different discrete symbols or movements that we were using and on the other, in terms of.

120
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:42,570
sejo: Even though he was like this kind of messy map at the end it was based on specific different disparate rooms, you could be seen and these props for that first.

121
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:50,910
sejo: Marking that this witness and then some of these products have to live with connecting there were people in common so.

122
00:35:50,910 --> 00:36:07,740
sejo: People but it's been in the worship, or in the cohort that were like you're performing in the stage or like in the back end or coordinating what was happening here represented, either as their bodies know or as these like little circles.

123
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:20,340
sejo: And finally there's some arrows like also to help me like show her think about how them, for example, in this case from having said, I mean it was a.

124
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:28,140
sejo: constraint set of movements, but also the activity concept consisted in like making a linear linear sequence of them.

125
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:40,830
sejo: And also thinking about them up or day this graph of rooms, even though it was a map and the end one as a participant was like linear racing this this.

126
00:36:40,830 --> 00:37:00,030
sejo: map and having like a specific sequence of rooms that has been visited so the narrow, so the way this idea of when going through and yeah I think their dimension of time and in this case not adding the dimension of having a sequence of this is great elements.

127
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:03,120
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Thank you.

128
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:08,580
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So let's see we have two more sections.

129
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:22,410
Garrett Laroy Johnson: In the first one i'm going to ask you to you have all these props i'm going to ask you to set them aside for a moment either physically or mentally or both.

130
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:30,150
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And you'll also have a five minute Q, in which.

131
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:35,700
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You were invited to make three new props.

132
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,000
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Based on these terms.

133
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:47,340
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And these are the names of props these names have come from the previous interview me.

134
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,530
Garrett Laroy Johnson: They are phone.

135
00:37:49,530 --> 00:38:00,090
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Three dots and rotation okay so you're asked to make three separate props one for each or more.

136
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:04,530
Garrett Laroy Johnson: But at least three that you can point to and say, these are the three.

137
00:38:04,530 --> 00:42:00,930
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And it's up to you to interpret them how I really like.

138
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:43,500
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Give a little more than a minute.

139
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,010
sejo: Okay, I think i'm done.

140
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:49,980
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I just want to show which ones are which really.

141
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,170
Is.

142
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,250
Garrett Laroy Johnson: The legs Lewis from.

143
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,990
sejo: yeah, so this is.

144
00:42:54,990 --> 00:43:00,810
sejo: So this little window into the world.

145
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:11,790
sejo: And the three dots mean that I thought of them as a group, and so that's why they're connected here and.

146
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:17,850
sejo: I thought about these like what protractor, I think, or something like that not like this tool to.

147
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:35,400
sejo: Ensure, and again I was thinking, I mean I mean I supervised by me teaching about this last week or something, and so I think i'll rotation, I agree with respect to something relative to so you have a reference and then you rotate according to.

148
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,400
sejo: an axis of rotation.

149
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,800
Garrett Laroy Johnson: awesome Thank you.

150
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,810
Garrett Laroy Johnson: that's great okay so we're at the last one here.

151
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:48,570
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And this is an opportunity to.

152
00:43:48,570 --> 00:44:02,220
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Put it all together, so you have your the props from your project, the props from allison kate's project, you have your connective props and now you have these three other wildcard props.

153
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:19,860
Garrett Laroy Johnson: In 10 minutes you're invited to use these props as a kind of conceptual material technical vocabulary and use these that vocabulary, in order to.

154
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:30,810
Garrett Laroy Johnson: articulate a new research question that would see a stream of inquiry or creative work or both, of course.

155
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:33,120
Garrett Laroy Johnson: anywhere in between.

156
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:46,020
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Your, of course, under no obligation to actually make this creative work, so it can be as aspirational large scale small scale experimental as you like.

157
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,270
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Any questions about that.

158
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:51,180
um.

159
00:44:51,180 --> 00:45:03,480
sejo: So yeah just to recap, so I will be using these products together to trying to solve the thing I mean I really like thinking out loud and trying to get to this.

160
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,600
sejo: line of inquiry research question or something.

161
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:16,980
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Yes, yes, and you don't have to think about it in terms of research, questions if you don't like it could be instead a guiding question of some kind or problematic or something like this.

162
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,390
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah cool okay i'll go ahead and start the.

163
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:33,840
lesson.

164
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:54,780
sejo: Yes, i'm thinking terms of.

165
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:58,200
sejo: Okay, so.

166
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:09,030
sejo: I have this project that had to do with having like a defined predefined set of symbols slash movements that.

167
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:21,660
sejo: involves collaborating with other people like having them learning or exploring this idea of a technic movement technic based on this so.

168
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:30,480
sejo: I mean now i'm realizing now that what we were interacting via screen.

169
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:47,010
sejo: mediated by these rectangles, we could see each other yeah this way, and then we were like assembling sequences of this a predefined set of movements, so we were like a linear writing them.

170
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:51,150
sejo: and

171
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:54,900
sejo: One hand there's also also some of these people.

172
00:46:54,900 --> 00:47:01,500
sejo: also participated in this or creator.

173
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,100
sejo: And in.

174
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:13,170
sejo: Another project to do as I was saying, but I will be using it again like connecting different like this beautiful rooms.

175
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:25,170
sejo: and different possible paths between them, some of them like maybe you could go from one to another direct directly on my way to in order to get to another, you have to.

176
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:39,030
sejo: Take a longer path so some of this people were disabled people in their activity where people either performing or.

177
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:43,800
sejo: Like coordinating the the.

178
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:55,710
sejo: The day event, while myself, and I will like interacting via miles in that in this world, and what i'm wondering now is about them.

179
00:47:55,710 --> 00:48:03,810
sejo: Well, I realize now or I when I when I made this problem with the arrows and I had to deal with.

180
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:12,150
sejo: Taking these discrete components that are very like natural law to the traditional world or that's how it is defined.

181
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:20,850
sejo: Basically, having these three elements and then connecting them, even though, like we were like using our bodies and connecting these elements are in this day and we have this.

182
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:39,270
sejo: Beautiful graph or how these are connected at the end, we had this tomb aspect on the street element, and then we were traversing them and linear writing them some of this is making me wonder and.

183
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:42,060
sejo: about them.

184
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:45,660
sejo: And if there could be a possibility of.

185
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:49,260
sejo: Using a.

186
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:53,760
sejo: computer or computer systems.

187
00:48:53,760 --> 00:49:06,810
sejo: I mean I it's kind of paradoxical number using them in a way that would imply not even either not having a evidentially discrete component or also.

188
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:11,100
sejo: Or, more importantly, am.

189
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:20,370
sejo: not linear racing them know or not having a like a linear experience I wouldn't really know how to approach it yeah i'm thinking about.

190
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:28,320
sejo: I mean, I will like kind of choked on realizing now and about decently even though at that moment, I was like.

191
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:35,670
sejo: really surprised and I really enjoyed the idea of these map that you could cover some stuff in.

192
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:42,390
sejo: The DM like my experience in that map was linear so I mean.

193
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:53,430
sejo: I love I love this is like to be like qualification, the way their statements, but yeah, but I am relatively level and i'm wondering how could that.

194
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:55,800
sejo: Be.

195
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:08,160
sejo: Like broken or how could we use like these million euros on a yes, on one hand, how can we go beyond the rectangles other screens, on the other, and I.

196
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:13,050
sejo: mean my brother had to do with using the rectangles because we were like far away and we have to.

197
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:19,290
sejo: have this activity, well, but this activity could be done, like in a physical space without having the.

198
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:36,630
sejo: detail mediation, but at the end, I mean by the nature of the project had to do with discrete components and having a sequences of them, it was like the point of it and, like exploring competition in the US like non electronic way, but now, this is making me realize or think about.

199
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:38,640
sejo: A.

200
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:55,650
sejo: yeah using Internet explorer to really convey, something that is not a linear or discreet, and to what extent that can be actually done like I mean theoretically been like from a computer science perspective.

201
00:50:55,650 --> 00:51:00,330
sejo: Even though or also like I mean that also brings me to think about the.

202
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:10,230
sejo: universe as a whole, and maybe quantum physics are either what extent like also like the universe is made of discrete parts or not and.

203
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:25,740
sejo: So another like so bringing back to then bringing it back to the electronic device enough to what extent do we develop some kind of experience, like group experience on how that goes go beyond them.

204
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:33,930
sejo: This week components of linear writing those components.

205
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:46,440
sejo: mean I mean, I guess, I didn't have to use all of them, but I doing just on the props, then the white coats were funny and.

206
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:57,090
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah super um This is great, thank you, I don't I don't want to cut you off did you have anything were to say or 10 like you're kind of wrapping up there.

207
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:59,010
sejo: yeah I think that that's.

208
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:03,930
Garrett Laroy Johnson: awesome Thank you say whoa that's super rich.

209
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:09,330
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I love how everything is now commingling there on your folders.

210
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:12,780
Garrett Laroy Johnson: All these props are commingling.

211
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:21,060
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, so thank you for this, there is just two more things for you to do one is.

212
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:25,680
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Part of the procedure, the other one is a housekeeping thing.

213
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:33,240
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So, in terms of procedure so as you got your wildcard prompts from somebody.

214
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:42,450
Garrett Laroy Johnson: else from the previous interview at your now invited to pass them pass on some props.

215
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:49,680
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Beyond yourself I should note here that.

216
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,470
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You are the last interview.

217
00:52:52,470 --> 00:53:00,990
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So, so I don't know who you will pass on to but there's maybe a way that they may be used as I, as I go through things here.

218
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:08,820
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah and analyze them so you're invited to pass on some props to the universe, I suppose.

219
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:16,380
Garrett Laroy Johnson: They may be props that you have created and maybe one of the wild card props maybe you need to invent a new prop right now.

220
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:25,620
Garrett Laroy Johnson: To pass on okay.

221
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:57,390
sejo: Something.

222
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:01,680
sejo: In the chat so ranch room and.

223
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,730
Garrett Laroy Johnson: awesome super rich.

224
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:07,500
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay.

225
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:14,580
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Do you have any questions that's a wrap on the creative portion.

226
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:18,030
sejo: No, I mean I like it.

227
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:18,840
Garrett Laroy Johnson: cool.

228
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:27,000
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah i'm glad I had fun, I appreciate that it's always it's it's been a joy to see how everybody and purchase this.

229
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,760
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah I particularly liked how many props you're able to make.

230
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,440
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I thought that many people would make many props but it's not the case so.

231
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,450
Many.

232
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:47,160
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah OK, so the very last thing is.

233
00:54:47,160 --> 00:55:00,630
Garrett Laroy Johnson: was very last thing I need to ask you to take some photos and you may upload them to you may either upload them back to the Google.

234
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:12,390
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Or, if you have more than 10 I think you have to email them to me, and that is fine too Okay, that is fine and the last thing is I just need to make sure I have your payment information.

235
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:17,940
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So I have, I have PayPal for say whoa at post do.net Is that correct.

236
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,320
yeah.

237
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:28,560
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Well, great then i'll send that to you in just a minute here, and if you have any problems receiving it, let me know of course okay.

238
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,980
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Otherwise, thanks so much.

239
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:36,990
sejo: problem yeah thanks for inviting again, I mean i'm sorry that I took like two weeks to respond, but.

240
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:37,830
Garrett Laroy Johnson: No it's fine.

241
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:40,620
sejo: But i'm glad that I could participate in.

242
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:46,140
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah me too, it is a help I appreciate that.

243
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:59,280
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah No two weeks is fine, I gave me some time to space out these other interviews and I thought that I wanted, maybe like 15 to 20 but it's been a lot of work, and I know that as as i'm doing more i'm wow this is going to be a lot to put together.

244
00:55:59,280 --> 00:55:59,790
sejo: yeah.

245
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,680
Garrett Laroy Johnson: in some way so.

246
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,440
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I think so you'll be the last one.

247
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,420
sejo: Just.

248
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:12,060
sejo: super super intrigued by how are you gonna like.

249
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:16,620
sejo: yeah like I always have I mean i'm interested in diving in reading whatever.

250
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:22,440
sejo: or watching or however you can do them yeah there'll be some writing for sure.

251
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:26,190
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And i'll be happy to share that with you and everybody who participated.

252
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:28,290
Garrett Laroy Johnson: to also be some multimedia.

253
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:38,880
Garrett Laroy Johnson: component that uses that the users, the photos and the video and somebody the video is just hard because there's just now there's so much event there's 10 hours of video.

254
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:52,380
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So i'm not sure exactly sure exactly what that will what that will look like in the multimedia thing I thought, maybe I would make, like a video piece, but I think I think, maybe, no, I think, maybe i'll just be.

255
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:58,920
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I don't know getting a few samples of likes of people talking about it, or maybe motioning.

256
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,610
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And kind of go from there, so.

257
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:02,850
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah.

258
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:05,190
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Anyway, i'll be happy to share with you as well.

259
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:06,630
sejo: yeah Thank you.

260
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,550
cool.

261
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:26,760
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And we'll stay in touch see how I am i'm following I think your website i'm going there sometimes and I find myself sharing this with people I think it's really cool or and yeah we tell you to see where it goes next do you have anything on the horizon.

262
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,360
sejo: Thank you well, on one hand, I mean I.

263
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:33,870
sejo: i'm applying to at the mako to.

264
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:36,120
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Oh yeah right that's great.

265
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,150
sejo: The show they I mean they.

266
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:54,180
sejo: Is a phrase that I wanted to show and mako 19 but I couldn't go, so I couldn't attend so but I mean I I don't know if I will be able to attend, but I like that a possibility of this happening digitally or something so.

267
00:57:54,180 --> 00:58:04,740
sejo: Yes, so that, like that was, I mean the data is so nice consequence of all these processes and me.

268
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:14,430
sejo: yeah having the opportunity of presenting without I mean day it has its challenges but i'm i'm interested in that, and then i'm also like on one hand, I have that.

269
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:16,890
sejo: and

270
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:26,700
sejo: yeah like i'm just like rick green like or during the project, I mean i'm thinking more about like these pedagogical aspect.

271
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,470
sejo: Of the sensitivities and.

272
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:48,570
sejo: And because sometimes I mean I haven't realized sometimes these if I just Fuck you liking, the speculative or performative aspect and sometimes I can get a little bit lost on that why Why am I doing this, or was there.

273
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:52,650
sejo: And, especially because he's like I know.

274
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:57,990
sejo: Like on the margin is now thinking about like non electronic computers and stuff is like can be.

275
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:08,520
sejo: really difficult like to have other people relate with these ideas about unfortunately like Islam, or in other context, and I have been able to find other people relating to it and.

276
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:20,070
sejo: What was it like I mean, I find it interesting that originally all these activities or these ideas came from me teaching and teaching about competition like concepts, so I.

277
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:26,670
sejo: mean like just recently, like in the past few days or a few hours, and I have been thinking about a.

278
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,800
sejo: Trying to.

279
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:39,930

280
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:42,930
sejo: Of these CDs activities against.

281
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:46,170
Performance isn't.

282
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:48,180
Garrett Laroy Johnson: That sounds rich.

283
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:58,740
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah I mean there was a way that I guess in what lingered for me about your project, it was also that it becomes the I mean it's fundamentally a social practice.

284
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:11,790
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Whether it's pedagogical or you call it, social or community or something, and you know is is maybe less important than it becomes a it becomes a process of transmission and dissemination.

285
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:13,920
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Through the body through the social.

286
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:22,410

288
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,500
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I don't know I think they'd be very interested in your work.

289
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:43,080
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I don't know if there's some way, you can submit something that for like a workshop or something like that.

290
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:59,820
Garrett Laroy Johnson: But yeah I think I think that group and maybe you find some other some other people who are interested from like a far you know and very different networks, and these are different networks and then you know moko and other things are plugged into.
