1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:02,850
Garrett Laroy Johnson: cloud.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,049
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, so Marcel you consented to recording.

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,719
Garrett Laroy Johnson: If at any time, you wish for me to stop the recording please indicate, and I will stop it.

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:30,090
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Likewise, your participation in general is voluntary, so if you choose to withdraw if you choose to walk away at any time, there is no penalty for that we may absolutely do that, and likewise okay so you've opted out of the.

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,610
Garrett Laroy Johnson: The cash incentive, which is, which is totally fine.

6
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:53,940
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, so about the video, so the video collected during the interview, as well as some photographs you'll take will be used to inform my dissertation and other and other informal publications or formal publications and there's no foreseeable risks or discomfort to your participation.

7
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:05,370
Garrett Laroy Johnson: About anonymity, so your responses will not be an anonymous by default, however, if there are some statements which you, you wish to be.

8
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:26,400
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You wish to be made anonymous indicate that to me during the interview, I will I will respect that, after the fact, likewise, if you wish to conduct the entire interview anonymously, let me know, and I will make that so and some okay so then.

9
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:43,710
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Right so some parts of the video documentation and the photographs may be made public as well, and those may be used in publications or other kinds of informal presentations any other questions any questions that you have about about any of that.

10
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:53,940
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: i'm totally fine with all of my you listed my only question is if if there is a chance of like reviewing whatever you.

11
00:01:53,940 --> 00:02:00,630
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: write with my name or, like all the video budget that before it goes online or public.

12
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,020
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Or is this too much of a of a extra workload for you.

13
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,270
Garrett Laroy Johnson: It may be.

14
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,330
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I don't say this.

15
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,130
Garrett Laroy Johnson: It may be a lot but.

16
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,160
Garrett Laroy Johnson: At the same time, I would say.

17
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:24,720
Garrett Laroy Johnson: The way that i'm envisioning this coming together is is probably less quoting people by name.

18
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:41,490
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And and more in my dissertation and he would be less quoting people by name and more maybe grabbing some things that have been said and relaying them, however, I think the The one thing would be.

19
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:50,970
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Also envisioning like an alternative presentation of this material that's that's you know is is the substance of the dissertation but it's not the written dissertation.

20
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,720
Garrett Laroy Johnson: which would be a kind of a multimedia format.

21
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,330
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And the photos would would figure largely in there, but i'm also considering.

22
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,670
Garrett Laroy Johnson: The.

23
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,990
Garrett Laroy Johnson: i'm also considering using some of some of the video.

24
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,390
Garrett Laroy Johnson: As well that's been put in there.

25
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:15,390
Garrett Laroy Johnson: In terms of reviewing that it may be, it may be tricky to do.

26
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,520
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And so I would maybe just ask you to self edit as you go if that's okay.

27
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,000
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: If that makes sense yeah totally.

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,120
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I appreciate the question.

29
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:41,580
Garrett Laroy Johnson: There will, I will make these materials, I will how about I say this, I will make these materials public to people who have participated in this if anytime you see something that you know you're that makes you uncomfortable i'll be happy to take that down yeah.

30
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,570
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: yeah no totally fine with me yeah this actually makes sense.

31
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:54,150
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, thank you okay great so we'll go ahead and get into the the structure itself.

32
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:05,220
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So in these 15 minutes we'll be making some props what is a prop prop is is something physical it's a material tangible thing.

33
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:16,080
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And, and what it does is maybe maybe it represents something maybe it does something maybe it inspires some line of thought, there are many different ways that are prob can.

34
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:28,260
Garrett Laroy Johnson: can function, you know, in a conversation and so we're going to make some of these in order to explore that in relation to the sun moko process.

35
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:43,110
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So, before I get into the broad overview of the different sections i'll just ask do you have some either craft materials office supplies or or everyday objects okay you're good to go.

36
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,440
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: I do.

37
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,390
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So you could you can just be grabbing.

38
00:04:45,390 --> 00:05:01,890
Garrett Laroy Johnson: stuff off your desk if that is more like quick and ready at the end you can also be making things more more craftily and then the other thing is you'll also need a camera or a smartphone to take some photos after our session.

39
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,780
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: I still had a phone.

40
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,370
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Totally fine yes good.

41
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,720
Garrett Laroy Johnson: that's perfect okay great then let's get started so.

42
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:26,700
Garrett Laroy Johnson: i'm going to get i'm going to keep time, these are chunks just so that we get through all materials, and we have enough, we have enough time for all of these sections, though some of them will be in 10 minute blocks, some of them will be in five minute blocks.

43
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:36,570
Garrett Laroy Johnson: i'll give you a prompt at the start, or speak, through it, you can ask questions, and if you have them and ask for clarification about things.

44
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:48,420
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And then, at that point i'll start the timer and let you go and during this during the the actual making i'm mostly sit back and sort of let you speak and make.

45
00:05:48,420 --> 00:06:03,900
Garrett Laroy Johnson: If you have questions that during during the the block of time you're welcome to ask them and i'm happy to answer but i'm mostly just just be here to observe and to it's less of a conversation let's say.

46
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:21,480
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And i'll give you a one minute warning right before the block of time this out you're also not obligated to take all the time, so if you get through a 10 minute section and it's six minutes your how much time do we have left that's all I have to say that's fine we'll move on.

47
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,950
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Any questions.

48
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:31,920
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: But yeah did you want me to rearrange now or later the mei mei like zoom set up, do you want to see my my desk or to you.

49
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,380
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: As i'm starting to make things.

50
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:43,620
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I think if that's easy for you to do that could be me people have been doing different things so and I think this is kind of an interesting contrast but yeah that that looks great.

51
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,180
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I love that something like this.

52
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,070
Garrett Laroy Johnson: See you and your desk.

53
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,490
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah cool.

54
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,630
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Alright, so.

55
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,270
In our first.

56
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:59,910
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Our first session i'm going to ask you to make some props.

57
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,060
Garrett Laroy Johnson: That support.

58
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:15,600
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Your reflection on your project that you presented at slo mo co so you will be asked to to speak about this to think aloud perhaps as you go.

59
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:29,940
Garrett Laroy Johnson: The tone of what you're what you're what you're saying does not need to be presentational or or expository you may simply just be thinking to yourself, maybe I want to grab this maybe I want to grab that.

60
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,630
Garrett Laroy Johnson: The way that you speak about your project.

61
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:49,290
Garrett Laroy Johnson: can be about how the project is structured technically it can be about how the project was structured conceptually it can be about how the project existed in your life at that time it's it's purposefully very open.

62
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,580
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Any questions about that.

63
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,230
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Yes, can you repeat just the like first sentence that you said.

64
00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:10,380
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Yes, so i'm going to ask you to make some props to to support your reflection on your project at slo mo co so as you reflect on this allowed.

65
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:20,520
Garrett Laroy Johnson: make some props that that help you think through this help you speak through this okay cool all right i'll go ahead and throw the clock.

66
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:47,430
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: 10 minutes.

67
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:55,320
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: So I did a project called them traces of noise for slow mako last year.

68
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:05,070
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And in order to think about or give you an idea of what was perhaps at stake in this project i'm going to i'm going to build.

69
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:10,770
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: One drop.

70
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:15,870
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: That may represent the the sort of the key trope that was.

71
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:37,980
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: The most at stake for me so i'm going to first make something.

72
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,380
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: is just a.

73
00:09:40,380 --> 00:11:11,490
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Little crosses in a blank sheet of paper.

74
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:20,670
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Can I think i'm just going to try to create little openings here this sheet of paper.

75
00:11:20,670 --> 00:12:02,130
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Along the Cross sister they cut here.

76
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:07,050
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: What what I what I wanted to make here is.

77
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:25,350
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: it's something that blocks my site or your site, but also let some of some of it pass and until traces of noise was basically a technical and the conceptual idea that that came about after me.

78
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,330
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Working on a on a previous series called setting.

79
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:35,640
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: That run for 15 years where I asked.

80
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:51,150
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: A number of amateur performers to play sound files on their phones on public outdoor spaces and according to a instruction score on how to sort of occupy.

81
00:12:51,150 --> 00:13:03,000
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: A public space sort of found stage and how to move through through this through these kind of places, and so in traces of noise for me.

82
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:16,020
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: It was about creating with smartphones which is like a big with this technology with personal phone so that everybody has more or less to create.

83
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:31,440
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: A hybrid environment that by hybrid I mean something that is inspired by like pokemon go where the outdoor surroundings and the content that is given to me on my phone blend.

84
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:38,550
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And, and so this is what what this prop stands for, I wanted to to really to create something that.

85
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,920
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: takes input.

86
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:52,500
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: But also takes pre made materials and blends them, so I work together with a software engineer, whom I met recently before slow moko happened.

87
00:13:52,500 --> 00:14:10,260
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: The computer scientists to help me develop an APP and the unfortunate thing about this APP is that it didn't quite work until the performance when, at the time when the performance actually happened, so I had to very much improvised in the end.

88
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:18,600
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: The idea was that people use their phone film The environment so basically take a walk.

89
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:40,740
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Now, this time, also because it was dependent like not on a on a on a shared public space, but everybody in their town and just on a public street and the idea was that the phone captures the walk so it films and records audio of the walk while.

90
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:47,490
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: there's a juxtaposed image on the on the camera image there's a juxtaposed sort of graphical.

91
00:14:47,490 --> 00:15:04,560
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: instruction notation of where they have to go so where the system sends them so basically arrows to the left to the right backwards forwards so very, very simple instructions so we're sort of a blended.

92
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:14,730
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: visual reality here on my phone screen with we're actually see the street and walking on, but I also see these little arrows.

93
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:25,530
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And the same happened with sound so sound was basically the the the carrier of information, if you will, where I made.

94
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:34,260
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: A sound piece beforehand that was pretty much generative were just synthetic sounds that the phones would play back.

95
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:57,810
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And then the sounds were obviously via the Speaker of the phone were admitted into into the streets on to get into the oral auditory reality that was the street and were captured again by the microphone of this very phone so again a immediate ation through the public space.

96
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:11,340
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And what was captured in the case of slow mo call I did around with four performers, one of which being I was so me and three.

97
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:23,430
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Other performance doing this recording footage they all sent it to me after the performance happened, I put it together in the sort of split screen video stream and.

98
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:35,010
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: made it public well in this case I didn't make it the public public I only made it public for the global coach community.

99
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:41,460
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: The prop that I made it really didn't turn out as I planned it.

100
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:48,300
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: But I think it does give an idea of the sort of the see through.

101
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:58,050
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: APP that I meant to make for a traces of noise and it definitely helped me think about what I.

102
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:04,380
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: What I was what I was going to say.

103
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,260
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: So, I guess, this is, this is it.

104
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:16,290
Garrett Laroy Johnson: super, thank you for that let's then pivot to the next activity and.

105
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:31,590
Garrett Laroy Johnson: In the next section I will ask you to repeat this activity you'll be asked to make a marker to support your reflection on not your project, this time, but a different project.

106
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:44,430
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So the same activity, except another project which may be remembered from your presentation Islam moko something else that was going on something else it's stuck out to you.

107
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:56,310
Garrett Laroy Johnson: From your engagement with some oco whatever whatever that looks like to you, and that may be a project that jumps out to you right now, if it doesn't.

108
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:04,020
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Your participation was was way back in the spring, and we can also have a look at the proceedings to sort of refresh.

109
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,740
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Memories any questions about that.

110
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:17,340
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: yeah I do think I will wouldn't need a refresher on on now I don't even remember the names of folks who were on the presentation with me on this sort of on the same panel.

111
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:22,590
Garrett Laroy Johnson: For, so let me go actually in your case we have those videos already.

112
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,750
Garrett Laroy Johnson: on YouTube.

113
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,900
Garrett Laroy Johnson: From the presentation, so I can send.

114
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,530
You.

115
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:40,470
Garrett Laroy Johnson: There, to the spring phase let's see how beautiful payloads here we go.

116
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:47,970
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So here are eight projects, including your no not including your own.

117
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:56,940
Garrett Laroy Johnson: which would have been presented during that time and if some of these stick out to you that's great.

118
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:02,430
Garrett Laroy Johnson: If not you can we can try something else.

119
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,120
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: yeah give me a minute, please too.

120
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,560
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Sure thing.

121
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:55,950
called.

122
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:02,490
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Okay, I think I think I think i'm good this was really just to when we activate my my memory.

123
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,680
super.

124
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,250
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, if you have any other questions i'll go ahead and start the clock.

125
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,840
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: But you want me to to to choose one.

126
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,730
Garrett Laroy Johnson: choose one if you can, if.

127
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:26,190
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah if it makes sense to speak about a couple or more in conjunction with each other, I certainly won't stop you from doing that.

128
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:35,730
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Now I can start I just need them and time to sort of figure out which one, I want to talk about asset that could be part of my answer I guess.

129
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,220
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Sure yeah that would be appropriate.

130
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:45,150
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: yeah good, so I think that the two projects that stuck most with me.

131
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:58,470
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: From last spring were a few dollars project and the placeholder of these tool in both cases, I really enjoy the the presentations.

132
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:05,790
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: and also the the converse the conversations after afterwards.

133
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:10,980
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And I think.

134
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:20,280
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: I think I want to talk more about Fidel yes project it stuck with me so much because.

135
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,370
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: We were amidst dependent MIC.

136
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:31,140
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And, and they chose to work on a project mainly about.

137
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,580
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: sort of digital communication tools and techniques.

138
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:48,420
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And Joseph to to focus on these moments of of in between, on these interstices on these moments of waiting, as someone else is typing.

139
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:58,410
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: An a message or a message to me and and they sort of have these like three dots popping up on my phone.

140
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:06,930
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And there was, I was really impressed that someone chose Esther vocabulary both conceptual and aesthetic.

141
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:14,790
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: disorder of these these wishful self of waiting as as content for their reflection and and work.

142
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,670
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And so.

143
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:27,750
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Now, as for making a prob that would best reflect or be present reflecting on alias.

144
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,800
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: project.

145
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:42,390
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: I think I was just inspired because when reflecting about my experience with my own project they started Coptic trusses when a sheet of paper.

146
00:22:42,390 --> 00:23:01,860
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And now, when I when I glanced at serious project again and I read, I saw again these the aesthetics of these dots popping up and and how they use this is static to to learn to create original video work.

147
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:07,290
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: I thought I I might stick with the aesthetic of of.

148
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:11,400
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: the.or the animated polka.so when.

149
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,550
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: i'm.

150
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,650
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: going to cut this.

151
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,140
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: piece of paper into.

152
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,750
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Then.

153
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:43,980
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: attempt at making a prop with them.

154
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,360
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Now that i'm thinking about fidelis project and.

155
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,130
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: realize their interest was was.

156
00:23:53,130 --> 00:24:05,310
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: mostly about if i'm if I remember correctly, mostly about digital communication tools, as they take place on smartphones or phones.

157
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,040
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: I realized that this is a.

158
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:18,600
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Is a relation of course between my project and their project so i'm going to retro actively correct my proper the first task and just cut it.

159
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,330
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: In the shape of a mobile phone.

160
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:35,340
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: With rounded corners.

161
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,660
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: OK, so now here we have the.

162
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:44,790
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: sort of smartphone with the crosses in it.

163
00:24:44,790 --> 00:25:00,330
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: For the second prompt gonna make another smartphone.

164
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:12,480
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And it's interesting how normative the sort of the symbolic of a smartphone is that a rectangle with rounded corners in portrait.

165
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,300
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: orientation sort of is enough to signify.

166
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,310
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: phone.

167
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:24,780
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: So now.

168
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:35,280
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Using a pencil to draw little circles.

169
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:48,660
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And i'm drawing three of them because three is the is the sign for waiting.

170
00:25:48,660 --> 00:27:15,120
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And i'm cutting them out.

171
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,070
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: So I think this is what I got for now.

172
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,260
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: yeah I think i'll stop here.

173
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,550
Garrett Laroy Johnson: super very nice Thank you.

174
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:30,840
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So you're already anticipating a bit the third prompt, which is great.

175
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:50,880
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So in this next block of time there will be five minutes and in five minutes and I will ask you to make now a third set of props and one or more which connect these two projects in some way.

176
00:27:50,880 --> 00:28:04,860
Garrett Laroy Johnson: These can be material connections, you can actually connect the props they can also be a third prop that that signifies that kind of conceptual connection between the two or.

177
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,040
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Do you have any questions about that.

178
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,560
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: No, I don't.

179
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:18,090
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Great then i'll put five on the clock and i'll give you one minute when we're so far.

180
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:27,090
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Good.

181
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:40,980
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: So yes, as I said before, to pretty obvious connection is the connection by by the media used or devices used phones in this case.

182
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:47,730
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: All I could think about making a third set of phones or I could simply.

183
00:28:47,730 --> 00:29:02,370
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: attach these two phones to one another and sort of create a Meta film that has two distinct different surfaces, and I think i'm going to do the ladder.

184
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:15,900
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: For which I do need, I think, in order to be for this prop to be effective, like materially speaking I need these openings to be bigger so that we can actually.

185
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:47,790
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: still see through so i'm going to first make these openings bigger larger and then going to stick these two somehow together.

186
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:51,990
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Please tell me every minute how many minutes I have left.

187
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,370
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Sure, I can do that.

188
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,990
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So you have three and a half minutes.

189
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,370
Garrett Laroy Johnson: left, right now.

190
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,470
Good.

191
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:03,480
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Just feel like being on a TV show and making something very fast.

192
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,070
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah maybe that's maybe that's encouraging as well.

193
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,110
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: I like this.

194
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,390
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Definitely not something i'm doing everyday.

195
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:16,680
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Good yeah I hope it's fun.

196
00:30:16,680 --> 00:31:16,320
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Oh yeah.

197
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,210
Garrett Laroy Johnson: That there is no judgment with regards.

198
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,150
Garrett Laroy Johnson: To artistic quality.

199
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,070
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Good i'm glad.

200
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,560
Garrett Laroy Johnson: or judgment at all for that matter.

201
00:31:25,560 --> 00:32:01,500
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: it's good.

202
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,170
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Okay well we're doing all the little.

203
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:07,980
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: pieces of tape we're assembling this.

204
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:43,980
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Great just about one minute.

205
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,550
Garrett Laroy Johnson: seconds.

206
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:51,390
Little more than hey.

207
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,360
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: i'm going to be successful, with.

208
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:02,370
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: One very beautiful round corner in 3D, which is all of explanatory.

209
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:10,620
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: forum for the entire crop so it's now a spatial paper phone.

210
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:18,780
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: which has two sites which you can't really tell because now it's it's all very dark.

211
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:26,100
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: But perhaps once I take photos you can tell that there's a there's one side with them with crosses or like.

212
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:32,100
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: yeah crumbled openings and there is one with them with three dots.

213
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,510
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Great this is awesome Thank you.

214
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:40,200
Garrett Laroy Johnson: it's a nice piece.

215
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:47,580
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, so now we can take a deep breath, if we want yeah.

216
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,270
Garrett Laroy Johnson: we're going to do something a little bit different.

217
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,870
Garrett Laroy Johnson: This will be another five minute block.

218
00:33:54,870 --> 00:34:09,810
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And also asking you to do some things quickly, and so we have the names of three products from the last interview.

219
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:31,620
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And in five minutes you're asked to create a prop inspired by these names or according to these names, however, you interpret them the three props are bracelet or some kind of wrist accessory slippers and fail.

220
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,620
Garrett Laroy Johnson: and any questions about this activity.

221
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:39,450
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Yes, so you want me to make one prop inspired by these three.

222
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,920
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Three products.

223
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,300
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Three drops each one of them, inspired by one of these words.

224
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,530
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Correct yeah.

225
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:49,710
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Yes, so like another lightning round.

226
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:54,480
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Right and bracelet just in terms of.

227
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,180
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: My English English language skill, a bracelet this what is a bracelet.

228
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,220
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: that's how you were around the neck right.

229
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,880
Garrett Laroy Johnson: that's a bracelet something around the risk, so the race.

230
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,150
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Right.

231
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:09,540
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I don't I don't have a bracelet, but I have this.

232
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,260
Garrett Laroy Johnson: patch cable and now.

233
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,760
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I have a break slip.

234
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:25,170
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Good simple as they also did specify, it can be any wrist accessory so Watch also comes to mind.

235
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:27,420
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: yeah.

236
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,120
Garrett Laroy Johnson: i'll set.

237
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,850
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Well, yes I hope yep.

238
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:46,410
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Great so i'll put five on the on the clock, and I can again give you four minutes three minutes two minutes, so you can pace yourself accordingly.

239
00:35:46,410 --> 00:36:01,980
Garrett Laroy Johnson: let's go.

240
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,540
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: The most straightforward and fastest.

241
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:15,240
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: lightning idea I can come up with.

242
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,500
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Blue stripe of paper together.

243
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:38,010
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And what i'm doing now is the negative, of the three dots that I cut out before for fidelis project i'm going to glue on to this bracelet so what this is is it's actually a a sort of.

244
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:47,190
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: bracelet that we present waiting, as in digital communication tools.

245
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,930
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Okay.

246
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:51,570
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: This is done.

247
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,310
Garrett Laroy Johnson: For me.

248
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:59,550
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: For the slippers we're gonna.

249
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,690
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: be really nice to reuse this bracelet for.

250
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,570
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: which it just be.

251
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:09,240
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Like.

252
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:23,040
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: flip flop style.

253
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:31,980
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Like the simple slipper ever.

254
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:39,990
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Again, it could be, it could be could be a slippers slippers slippers of waiting with just three dots, so I think i'm just gonna.

255
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:47,310
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: be inspired by this aesthetics, that we have started and attached three dots.

256
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:54,570
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: will depend, with a marker.

257
00:37:54,570 --> 00:38:07,980
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Three minutes.

258
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:16,500
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: The technical ventilator that is rotating or sort of an audience and.

259
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,390
Garrett Laroy Johnson: They wanted to leave it open.

260
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:23,280
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Okay cool.

261
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:29,850
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: that's the toughest one.

262
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:34,410
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: mean I found this is sort of the object fan, and we use in the summer.

263
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:52,320
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Is it's great to talk about waiting and more recondition of waiting since it's sort of represents itself, the new said movies, as a sort of representation of nothing is going on, just like the machine rotating so i'm probably just.

264
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,990
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: gonna make a.

265
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,930
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Very simple.

266
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:01,290
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Presentation of the fans.

267
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:25,980

00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,600
cool.

275
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:11,910
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I love the fan I love the waiting motif as well.

276
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,850
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah this will be fun.

277
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:18,390
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So okay.

278
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:24,090
Garrett Laroy Johnson: We can also again take a deep breath and.

279
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:31,080
Garrett Laroy Johnson: take stock of all these props that we now have in front of us.

280
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,820
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And we can begin to.

281
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:41,070
Garrett Laroy Johnson: assume this body of props as a kind of.

282
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:47,490
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Creative vocabulary that we have at our disposal ready at hand.

283
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:54,390
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And in the next block, and this is the final product, making block you have 10 minutes.

284
00:40:54,390 --> 00:41:13,890
Garrett Laroy Johnson: you're invited to use this body across as a creative language in order to formulate a research question that could seed, a new work, a new creative work or some some stream of research, a stream of inquiry.

285
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:23,340
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Just like the other examples, or the other sections you're invited to think aloud as you go.

286
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:29,340
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Questions about that which, like me to repeat that.

287
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:42,570
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: yeah one question is, do we, the stock of props that we have by now do we still need them like is it a possibility to destroy them now or make them into something else in this one.

288
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:47,970
Garrett Laroy Johnson: From crater sure, yes, you can alter them now, at this point.

289
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:52,980
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Excuse me, in order to create something new.

290
00:41:52,980 --> 00:42:07,500
Garrett Laroy Johnson: As well you're not obligated to use all of the props you may leave some aside and you also may find that you need new materials new props in order to bring these together in a cohesive way.

291
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,690
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: yeah and I think i'm good.

292
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:13,500
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Great all right on the clock.

293
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:19,500
Garrett Laroy Johnson: proceed when every like.

294
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,870
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: I think i'm gonna start.

295
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:39,510
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: mapping things out and very much a mind map person so i'm not definitely not the proper person normally and, as you might be able to tell that not normally making paper props.

296
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:48,870
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: So research question.

297
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,250
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: here.

298
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:59,970
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: In the middle, so what is interesting now for me while making things in paper is that.

299
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:14,280
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Well, it was my choice to use paper in the first place, but do it with a make something paper, the problem it's always it's 2d and So how do I sort of move out of the plane, the paper plane and move out into space.

300
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:43,560
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And the bracelet is a is a sort of great segue or a great tool for me to think about to the 3D matters, just because the brace that is basically a flat piece of material and just by the nature of of how it gets us is like turn into a 3D prop and so i'm actually going to make this now.

301
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:53,730
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Because I didn't have enough time before.

302
00:43:53,730 --> 00:44:00,060
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: So this is what I like about paper, and now we got something three dimensional.

303
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:07,170
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: bracelet which now of course too tiny for my big hand.

304
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,150
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: But it's still here.

305
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:17,280
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: So one thing i'm going to put down as a bird is just.

306
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,780
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: flat.

307
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,250
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: flat.

308
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:25,260
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: plane.

309
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:29,670
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: flight plane and then.

310
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:37,680
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And then three dimensional object.

311
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,880
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And then the other thing have been or we've been.

312
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:47,730
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Talking about now is is the phone.

313
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:56,940
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And one thing we have been talking about this digital communication.

314
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:02,340
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And one more item will be hybrid.

315
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,770
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: reality.

316
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:16,380
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: I think, is probably a very bad form at this point in it and then make were hybrid only refers to online teaching modes, but what I mean by hybrid will use the sort of pokemon go.

317
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,730
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: blended realities between virtual and then the actual.

318
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:24,390
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And that's what I mean with hybrid.

319
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:28,470
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And we have the rotation.

320
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:32,730
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Of the fan as a representation of.

321
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:38,220
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Time passing.

322
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:43,170
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: rotating machine rotation.

323
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:47,940
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And we have the modality of waiting.

324
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:53,790
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: With.

325
00:45:53,790 --> 00:46:05,160
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: us.

326
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:14,010
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: waiting.

327
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:21,240
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Soldiers a connection.

328
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,010
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Then we have.

329
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:32,160
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Three dots as both a symbolic representation as an almost icon and digital communication tools, but also as a.

330
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,270
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: As a series of three dots sort of.

331
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:39,810
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Actual.

332
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:58,920
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And still which will visual language that is sort of that transcends language.

333
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,670
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: How are we doing with time.

334
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:04,770
Garrett Laroy Johnson: you're right at five minutes.

335
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:09,210
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Good I wanted to it good I wanted to brainstorm for five.

336
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:14,340
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And then bring things together, in the latter five so.

337
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:20,790
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: i'm going to stop here and now bring this all together and make sense of it.

338
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:26,850
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: We have a sand we have slippers we have this.

339
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:29,550
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: 3D phone.

340
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:35,070
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And we have a bracelet.

341
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:53,940
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: It will be nice if this still.

342
00:47:53,940 --> 00:48:01,530
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: yeah.

343
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:07,410
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: i'm striving to really bring the props together since.

344
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:11,520
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Since they were self distinct they're more they're more.

345
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:20,670
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Actual objects them representation of something bigger the fan here is just a fan the slippery years just to slip brand the bracelet is.

346
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:37,980
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Basically, just a slip the bracelet perhaps that's the most interesting object here a bracelet just because and what what I said before, how it sort of transcends from a flat into a spatial real and so.

347
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:49,440
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: I think what a research question would be is to sort of 111 question properly a very, very.

348
00:48:49,440 --> 00:49:00,780
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: or not so an interesting question but still a research question will be it for it for moving from 2d screens on phones into virtual environments where we have.

349
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:17,130
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: goggles on or like sort of virtual realities, how would these the iconography of waiting, how would this change in 3D space so where would we go with three dots as sort of a flat symbol.

350
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:28,830
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And all this could be an inquiry into the aesthetic of of waning in the in in 3D space so that's that's something that I, I will find interesting the other.

351
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:39,360
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: place where we could go with all of this is sort of finding and wish will language for waiting in hybrid realities.

352
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:50,670
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: How could we, how could we look on a map APP like while navigating the city and sort of half an icon of graffiti of waiting.

353
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:53,820
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: on it in it with it.

354
00:49:53,820 --> 00:50:03,360
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And yet another like sub question of that will be how would we How would we go about a.

355
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:16,170
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: representation or wish a language of waiting in sound what will be a sound cure for the same thing So these are three questions now that i'm coming up with.

356
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:24,330
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: That might be interesting and pursuing.

357
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:31,770
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Right, you have two minutes in case you want to take any more time, otherwise we can move on.

358
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:37,920
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Just a SEC.

359
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,900
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: And just completing this this mind map putting sound.

360
00:50:42,900 --> 00:51:21,870
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: down.

361
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:25,740
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Okay, I think this is a this is good.

362
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:31,110
Garrett Laroy Johnson: awesome fantastic Thank you.

363
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:47,460
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So we're done making problems, probably us over there's just there's really just to two more sections one is still a little bit creative and the last one is more of a housekeeping issue.

364
00:51:47,460 --> 00:52:06,390
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So for this last part you are invited to select up to three of your props in order to pass on to the next interviewee so you received bracelets slippers and Van you're now invited to take.

365
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:17,040
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Three of the props that you made or bracelet flippers and fan, you can use these two if you're feeling compelled, you can also make up now on the spot.

366
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:37,020
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Three new or any number of new product names that you wish to pass on just like you received three names rewards and likewise the next interview he will receive three or three words or three phrases, not an image of these.

367
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:40,980
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: mm hmm.

368
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:45,870
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Good Of course I have too many.

369
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:48,330
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: I think I will go with.

370
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:50,820
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: phone.

371
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:54,900
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: which I have built.

372
00:52:54,900 --> 00:53:02,400
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: I will go with three dots which I also have built.

373
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,950
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: and

374
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:09,210
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: I don't have too many for the third.

375
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:16,230
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: I would like to choose.

376
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:19,200
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: rotation.

377
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,230
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Which is not a noun but.

378
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:25,050
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: or not a noun not an object.

379
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:27,630
Garrett Laroy Johnson: II that works.

380
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:29,580
Garrett Laroy Johnson: That works very well.

381
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:34,860
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And Marcel Thank you, that concludes all the.

382
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:46,140
Garrett Laroy Johnson: serious business of this of this session, the very last thing and in terms of instructions that I have or invitations to invite you to take some photographs of these.

383
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:57,840
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And those photographs I would love it if you could submit them to the two seconds to two to.

384
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:05,010
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You may submit it to the form here that you filled out initially at the very end, is a question, where you can.

385
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:20,550
Garrett Laroy Johnson: add up to 10 photographs and if you become very enthralled with taking photographs and take more than 10 photographs that's great I love that simply send them to my email and and i'll be able to import them that way.

386
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:20,910
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Okay.

387
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:25,440
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: The form sorry I was just clicking on I did says, is no longer accepting responses.

388
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:34,110
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Oh, I can that's just because I didn't want anyone signing up for new thoughts i've.

389
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:41,640
Garrett Laroy Johnson: i've just changed that you should be able to refresh and submit them there.

390
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,520
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And you.

391
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:49,800
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: know I do you want me to I can do it after that, after the conversation with you right or do you want me to do.

392
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,150
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: To do it right now.

393
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:54,570
Garrett Laroy Johnson: No, you can you can do it on your own on your own time.

394
00:54:54,570 --> 00:55:00,240
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: yeah and and just just the props that they made.

395
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:00,570
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: yeah.

396
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:10,440
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah yeah You may think about you know how you want to display them how you want them to be seen.

397
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:22,500
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I think, having individual shots of individual props will be very interesting and, if you want to sort of put them in configurations and stage them in different ways that's also very interesting for me.

398
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,210
yeah.

399
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:30,180
Garrett Laroy Johnson: But I leave that mostly open to you just that I want it would be great to have many pictures.

400
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:35,010
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Good not as good, but I do want to make one picture with you still on the call is fine.

401
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:37,950
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Take a picture of you yeah.

402
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:44,790
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah.

403
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:45,090
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: damn.

404
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:48,000
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Nice good.

405
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,370
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Thanks so much Marcel this was really fun, I really enjoyed this session this morning.

406
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:55,140
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Of course.

407
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,970
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Thank you.

408
00:55:56,970 --> 00:56:12,240
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: yeah no, thank you, I have to say it was very inspiring it actually it actually made me, you know make connections that otherwise I wouldn't have made so you know I feel like go to the studio right now and start something.

409
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:20,220
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Nice wow that's that's something I well that's how the recording.

410
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:23,850
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah that's really interesting I mean, I think.

411
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:38,670
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You know, for me, i'm inspired by i'm inspired by you know, conferences and festivals and and reading groups and just and places where people come together and share ideas, and I have a sense intuitively that.

412
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:49,050
Garrett Laroy Johnson: there's always something where there's sometimes something that lingers about that experience right and then and then maybe comes out later at some.

413
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:59,910
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Future time like in a month or in like 10 years you know it always sort of depends, and so what I really wanted to design with this was a process where.

414
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:09,960
Garrett Laroy Johnson: We can, maybe more intentionally try to create a space where we can pull out some of those lingering things and see what could be done with them in like.

415
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:24,120
Garrett Laroy Johnson: sort of like a pressure cooker kind of environment right just to see as it like can we generate a toy example of like what this what this experience could produce in long term.

416
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:31,890
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: No absolutely absolutely and I think it really works so also you sort of this certified my.

417
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:35,700
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: My projection of what this interview is going to be just because I think some.

418
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:46,800
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Where you wrote that it's going to be about the collaborative process and I anticipate that there might be questions at slo mo and there might be questions like you know how.

419
00:57:46,800 --> 00:58:06,930
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: How did they experience the sort of the collaborative spirit at slow moko or or some within my team of with my performers and, until then, until I definitely did not expect that I will be making stuff and sort of come up with new ideas, which is the best outcome ever for me.

420
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:10,260
Garrett Laroy Johnson: that's awesome no i'm happy to hear that.

421
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:24,480
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah I mean there's you know collaboration, I guess what I want to do is is also the kind of explode the model of collaboration and what what Labor maybe even means like.

422
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:29,790
Garrett Laroy Johnson: What, how can we do work for each other, how do we already do work for each other.

423
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:33,810
Garrett Laroy Johnson: in ways that don't look like collaboration.

424
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:42,720
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And what was important about this workshop was to it's really a workshop on the interview right.

425
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:57,870
Garrett Laroy Johnson: is to is to see what happens after people go home right when that when the collective has disbanded and you know we individually it again we become individuals before you know meeting up with other people again collaborating.

426
00:58:57,870 --> 00:59:03,180
Garrett Laroy Johnson: What do we take with us right.

427
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:07,410
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So yeah I mean that's interesting though that.

428
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:18,060
Garrett Laroy Johnson: it's interesting that none of the questions are for you and speaking that collaboration did come up because you have this on the mind as well sounds like sounds like it took a detour for some time.

429
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,320
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Which is intraday yeah.

430
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,240
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: matt a good one yeah.

431
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:25,380
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: cool was it the sort of game.

432
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:41,190
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: That we're playing here with someone else leaving crisis, and then you know i'm sort of continuing that the thoughts that someone before had the I guess the order of people here, in the end of the interview is is this quite coincidental right.

433
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:56,580
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah absolutely I mean I could have I could have compose that you know if I had this the brain space and and you know, had people's schedules, you know at my disposal, but yeah it's.

434
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:08,250
Garrett Laroy Johnson: it's contingent on people's availability and when they responded and so on, and yeah I sort of Let that be and it's interesting too, because in fact I.

435
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:19,500
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I believe, somebody else mentioned for Delia already and their talk and i'm not sure did they maybe they did I thought they did.

436
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:34,740
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I thought somebody had introduced that already and it's and and maybe it didn't make it to the next round or at somewhere somewhere fell off something about waiting, but I interviewed them already to right, and so, for me now.

437
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:39,120
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You know I interviewed for the early on, on Friday, or Wednesday and.

438
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:48,180
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And yeah and so now, like everything that you're saying, for me, is of course contextualize by what they what they put into this as well.

439
01:00:48,180 --> 01:01:05,040
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So yeah you know i'm also realizing that there's you know for me yeah a lot of us contingent on people's schedules and when they showed up it's also contingent on how i'm showing up to these as well right that'll be you know absolutely.

440
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:11,730
Garrett Laroy Johnson: that'll determine to some degree, the way in which i'm able to make sense of these after the fact.

441
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:16,890
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Absolutely yeah you're acting here as the big and the silent collaborator.

442
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:22,440
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: I mean silent in the mode in a moment of my making, which is, which is totally.

443
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:30,510
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: there's like one ways like you're giving a prompt to me and then i'm doing something returning something to you is.

444
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:44,370
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Is is interesting because that's not what they normally get when collaborate, they were like sitting me and the friends in a room or on zoom I were having a conversation here it's much more sort of the third time.

445
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:44,880
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: yeah.

446
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,390
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Do you think something and then something is coming back.

447
01:01:48,390 --> 01:02:00,570
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah and for me too i'm i'm used to being a really active collaborator and also you know brainstorming along with people and methane, and so, for me, it's also it's a different role to sit back and be quiet.

448
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:19,560
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And it's also interesting that people then show up and and use me as a as a as a collaborator in different ways right, some people are really trying to have conversations with me and then they protect themselves oh I don't know if you can answer that question.

449
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,720
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Anyway, moving on you know.

450
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:40,530
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And then yeah others I actually had some of these, I felt myself become an audience Member right like like the the process itself, I realized, I was like Oh, this is now, this is a mundane performative event is what this is becoming right and i'm here.

451
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:48,840
Garrett Laroy Johnson: As a witness right that's an as an audience of you know, a minor spectacle so yeah I find all of that.

452
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:56,730
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: As well yeah except that there's so much in Tennessee to this moment of your your your audience but you're the only one.

453
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:58,500
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah yeah you're not.

454
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:04,620
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: Part of a big audience it's just like a one on one system most radical.

455
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:06,420
Marcel Zaes Sagesser: performance.

456
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:11,430

01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:10,770
Garrett Laroy Johnson: am not totally sure on on you know what i'm going to do with this, or what the motor analysis will be at first, I thought Oh, I need to do a video piece of this.

466
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:30,870
Garrett Laroy Johnson: But now i'm thinking something something else, where all of the the photos of these props and maybe like small snippets of quotations or like sound files of people saying certain things can be added into.

467
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:39,750
