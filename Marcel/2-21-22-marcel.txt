Fidelia, dots 

retroactive correction of prop --> cut into a mobile phone (rounded corners)

Part 4: Connection 

Part 5: Synthesis Set Up: 

from Shalaka
Bracelet 
Slippers 
Fan

Part 6: Synthesis: proposing a new project // 

bracelet 2d-3d, 
phone digital communication
hybrid reality // blended reality between virtual and actual; 

rotation of fan as representation of time passing 

the aesthetic of waiting as in digital communication tools 

[...] as a series of three dots 


having trouble --- objects stand as objects not as representations of things; 

one question: if we move from 2d to VR / 3D, how does the iconography of waiting change in 3D space (pace three dots, fan loading screen etc.).

a visual language for waiting in hybrid realities 

what is a sound cue for the same thing for waiting ? 


part 7: passing on (to Sejo).
