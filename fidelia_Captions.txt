1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,710
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Then, to the phone.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,280
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So if at any point during this.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:19,560
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You would like me to stop recording, for whatever reason, please say so and i'll stop the recording and on that note also your participation is voluntary.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:31,500
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So if at any point you choose you decide you no longer want to participate or, if you want to withdraw from the study entirely you may do that, of course, and there's no penalty for that.

5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:45,930
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You will receive $25 for participating in this 15 minutes section and so i'll just double check the that I have the Info to give that to you after the session.

6
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:55,290
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Yes, you submitted some local OK, and then about video and anonymity, so the video.

7
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:16,530
Garrett Laroy Johnson: collected during the interview, as well as some photographs will take what you make during this, I will be used to inform my dissertation and perhaps other subsequent research and there are no foreseeable risks or discomforts to your to your participation.

8
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:28,710
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Second, about anonymity so by default your responses will not be anonymous However, you may indicate to me that that any given thing that you want to say.

9
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:43,680
Garrett Laroy Johnson: That you want that to be anonymous I will respect that Likewise, if you say to me right now I want this entire I want everything that I say to be anonymous that I will make a note of that and that will be so.

10
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah I think that's that's that's it do you have questions about any any part of that.

11
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,540
Fidelia Lam: think so.

12
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,410
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Well, if you.

13
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:58,260
Garrett Laroy Johnson: really great if it's some come up please feel free to ask me about the moon ever.

14
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:10,260
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, so today we're going to make some stuff you're going to be invited to make stuff and and you also be invited to speak.

15
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:33,510
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You may, the emphasis is a little bit more on making speaking can be like a way of thinking aloud about what you're making and you might find that these just common different balances, as you go and that's totally fine, I think the idea is to just to to encounter the the.

16
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:44,610
Garrett Laroy Johnson: The directives that I offer up to you, however, they feel appropriate speaking of directives, this time is going to be chunked so we have 15 minutes and.

17
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,220
Garrett Laroy Johnson: will work in in a few 10 minute increments and then a few five minute increments.

18
00:02:50,220 --> 00:03:01,560
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And at the start of them i'll say something specific to you you'll have the opportunity to ask me questions as for clarification and then i'll start a timer i'll keep track.

19
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:16,140
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And then their time will be yours and then in that time you can begin making things you can begin speaking and responding and you may also like asking questions during that if something comes up and i'll answer, of course.

20
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:25,740
Garrett Laroy Johnson: are mostly kind of stand back and sort of let you have the space, and so I won't be interjecting too much.

21
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:48,360
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And also keeping time and i'll give you like a like a little one minute in the chat just to let you know to come, be in La and yeah and then at the end we'll just like do we sign off by making sure that I have you know where to put the photos.

22
00:03:48,360 --> 00:04:01,650
Garrett Laroy Johnson: taken the end so that's the big picture and, as I mentioned, will be making some things, so the very first thing that we can do is just make sure that we have the stage that, so to speak.

23
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:13,350
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Do you have some like a workspace do you have some objects that you can work with you have some craft materials paper pencil scissors these kinds of things.

24
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:24,900
Fidelia Lam: I think so um do you want that all here now like, should I go fetch things or can I like run around while where.

25
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,340
Fidelia Lam: i'm like in my apartment.

26
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:35,130
Garrett Laroy Johnson: that's yeah that's up to you, I think, if you want to feel like everything's in the right place ready to go then then now would be the time to do that otherwise i'm.

27
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,650
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Like if you need to run in touch things that.

28
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,270
Garrett Laroy Johnson: That might be fun too.

29
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,870
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So that's.

30
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,300
Fidelia Lam: more inclined to just run in such things, depending on what.

31
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,390
Fidelia Lam: You ask you're like I don't know what's happening so.

32
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,880
Garrett Laroy Johnson: cool yeah great perfect.

33
00:04:50,880 --> 00:05:00,390
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And then you'll also need like a just a cell phone or a camera to photograph the things afterwards okay.

34
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:13,200
Garrett Laroy Johnson: If we're all set on that, then we can go ahead and begin the first the first 10 minute block here, and so in this in this block you'll be invited to meet some props will be invited to make some stuff.

35
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:22,800
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And you're invited to make some stuff some props that allow you to speak about the project that you presented at slo mo grow.

36
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:33,120
Garrett Laroy Johnson: The way in which you speak about that project is up to you and it's not expected that you speak about this in a conference like tone.

37
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:51,030
Garrett Laroy Johnson: or tenor You may speak about your relationship to it, you may speak about what motivated it, you may speak about your experience of that at some loco whatever sticks out to you right now, and whatever the props whatever they prop up for you in terms of.

38
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,220
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah that 10 minutes is that clear, do you have any questions for me.

39
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,840
Fidelia Lam: Can you just say that all one more time so it's like in my head.

40
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,480
Fidelia Lam: Yes, absolutely.

41
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:19,260
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So you will be asked to make some props so some things that it could be everyday objects just things that are like right here, or maybe you want to construct it on something else, and those props.

42
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:36,690
Garrett Laroy Johnson: would ideally help you to speak about your project that you presented at sloan moko so maybe there is some aspect of that project, and you know it's really working like this right and like that made sense, given the context.

43
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:52,320
Garrett Laroy Johnson: you're invited to speak out loud as you're making these as you're bringing these things together, the way that you speak about these are totally up to you, so there's no expectations in terms of whether this will be.

44
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,520
Garrett Laroy Johnson: academic or every day or.

45
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:06,750
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You know, something which is you know more more couched in your everyday experience in your in your personal experience of of your arm aching back this.

46
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,350
Garrett Laroy Johnson: super.

47
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,940
Fidelia Lam: um do you want me to like take you with me or.

48
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,860
Garrett Laroy Johnson: If you want to have fun yeah, if you like it.

49
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,760
Fidelia Lam: might be messy and weird so sorry in advance.

50
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,840
Fidelia Lam: So um I guess you just want me to like.

51
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,520
Fidelia Lam: So I guess what comes to mind i'm just going to start rambling if that's cool.

52
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,790
Great.

53
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:45,150
Fidelia Lam: When I think about what I shared it slow mo code that is thinking a lot about like digital anticipation, but then there's also this element of race and covert and kind of modes of.

54
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,380
Fidelia Lam: expectation and.

55
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,950
Fidelia Lam: Like points of relation.

56
00:07:52,950 --> 00:08:01,740
Fidelia Lam: And I actually I don't know if you remember sell a who presented with Luke and curtis but we're all in the same Program.

57
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:21,540
Fidelia Lam: At usc and sell and I actually we had class, for the first time we're like we met in person, for the first time just a couple of weeks ago, and she mentioned my slow moko presentation that I actually had not completely forgotten about like oh yeah That was a while ago.

58
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,880
Fidelia Lam: What was I going to get and he's going to get.

59
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,660
Fidelia Lam: really want a sharpie and I have.

60
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:38,940
Fidelia Lam: I also have no idea what you're seeing on screen so again apologies fun recording for you to watch later.

61
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,850
Fidelia Lam: And I wanted.

62
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:47,250
Fidelia Lam: I wanted more paper.

63
00:08:47,250 --> 00:09:00,480
Fidelia Lam: You.

64
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,760
Fidelia Lam: Where does that leave me.

65
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,610
Fidelia Lam: about some oh.

66
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:18,240
Fidelia Lam: I don't know I feel like i'm always thinking about like surfaces as well wow what is lovely view of my apartment you're getting.

67
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:26,070
Fidelia Lam: And I was reading this interview with Paul Lansky last week because of something that curtis shared in our class.

68
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:32,610
Fidelia Lam: And he there's one line from this interview that i've like been sitting with a lot.

69
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,350
Fidelia Lam: He says, our perception of sand in the real world is often needs to tell us about what is.

70
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,060
Fidelia Lam: going to happen, we read the future by the sounds of the presence.

71
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:48,390
Fidelia Lam: And I was thinking about that in relation to expectation.

72
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,960
Fidelia Lam: And how there's like one.

73
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,160
Fidelia Lam: yeah he's writing about like implication.

74
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,760
Fidelia Lam: And the way that we extrapolate from implication I feel like i'm just rambling I don't know.

75
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,650
Fidelia Lam: um.

76
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:09,660
Fidelia Lam: And i've brought out all of these books and papers and things Why did I.

77
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:15,510
Fidelia Lam: Do all of this.

78
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:27,360
Fidelia Lam: And inhabiting similar like posture is insights what do I want to make I really wanted to draw.

79
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:34,980
Fidelia Lam: That was my one of the first thing that came to mind when you started talking.

80
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,730
Fidelia Lam: How much time do I have, I feel like i'm this again rambling.

81
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,980
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You have seven minutes you're doing great.

82
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,170
Fidelia Lam: Great Thank you, I appreciate the positive.

83
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,470
Fidelia Lam: yeah.

84
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,670
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Totally.

85
00:10:50,670 --> 00:11:01,410
yeah.

86
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:17,250
Fidelia Lam: Why don't we look at the email that Sola sent me because I was sent me an email about my presentation and maybe that'll be a nice point of reference for.

87
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,730
Fidelia Lam: This Okay, am I.

88
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,660
Fidelia Lam: Am I doing it wrong, we do like.

89
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:32,400
Fidelia Lam: ooh yeah entanglements oh yeah and where did it go but.

90
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:39,150
Fidelia Lam: So in this interview there's this I don't know if you see that symbol.

91
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:45,180
Fidelia Lam: Where did it go i've been doodling it on this one piece of paper.

92
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,050
Fidelia Lam: But I in my slow mo co presentation, you can still hear me right.

93
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:55,050
Fidelia Lam: yeah even my ear buds okay i'm just wanted to make sure um.

94
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:00,090
Fidelia Lam: I like one point of reference that I keep coming back to you are like one.

95
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:12,060
Fidelia Lam: ideas like idea of entanglements and thinking about like for Rod and specifically Rachel in those work and i've just been like doodling the symbol.

96
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:18,900
Fidelia Lam: So i'm just going to do that for a little bit and see what happens.

97
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:24,870
Fidelia Lam: Oh yeah and with that I was trying to memorize the specific.

98
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,340
Fidelia Lam: The specific like connection of.

99
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:50,550
Fidelia Lam: dots or layout of dots and if I could try it without looking at it.

100
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,980
Fidelia Lam: Would you like to witness my doodling or.

101
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,470
Garrett Laroy Johnson: that's not well whatever you like.

102
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:05,280
Fidelia Lam: that's like the best way.

103
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,730
Fidelia Lam: you're just on my gigantic coffee table that.

104
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:21,300
Fidelia Lam: has my salad and stuff.

105
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:45,480
Fidelia Lam: And I actually think I have it mostly memorized.

106
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,550
Fidelia Lam: And I don't actually know what the symbol is or why isn't this interview.

107
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:58,020
Fidelia Lam: But something about it has I don't know i've just been doodling it during like meetings and.

108
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,880
Fidelia Lam: Like something mindless to keep my hands busy but also.

109
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,160
Fidelia Lam: Something kind of fun.

110
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,320
Fidelia Lam: and also in the interview I just had a conversation with.

111
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:23,040
Fidelia Lam: A friend and like another person who's in our program her name is Sean Paul, but something that she said that related to the interview like this Polanski interview is.

112
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,070
Fidelia Lam: How like there's a universe in every seed i'm about to call.

113
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,660
Fidelia Lam: I forgot why I brought that up.

114
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,300
Fidelia Lam: anyway.

115
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,130
Fidelia Lam: So I want to stay black or do I want another.

116
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,520
Fidelia Lam: Another phone call it, how long do I have for this portion.

117
00:14:44,520 --> 00:15:05,820
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You have another two and a half minute.

118
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:12,060
Fidelia Lam: I feel like I haven't talked about slow mo code much.

119
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:20,370
Fidelia Lam: But entanglements and interconnected threads and circuits and now i'm just doing word association.

120
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:31,440
Fidelia Lam: Oh, I don't know if you heard that.

121
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:50,280
Fidelia Lam: And I mean what shontelle said in relation to the title of i'd actually eating seed potentials or something to like there's a world and every seed and how do we like actually that's something that's lovely to think about.

122
00:15:50,280 --> 00:16:19,770
Fidelia Lam: don't know where my screen pendants kind of wish they had.

123
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:26,610
Fidelia Lam: Can I ask what other interviews with them like where does that ruin for like best with.

124
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,710
Fidelia Lam: What you have intended.

125
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:33,900
Garrett Laroy Johnson: In very, very different each one of them has been very different.

126
00:16:33,900 --> 00:17:00,360
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Which is amazing to me and expect such a breath which yes, these have been really fun are keeping me on my toes.

127
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:15,930
Fidelia Lam: I don't really know what i'm doing I keep forgetting this one little bit of the trial, which is interesting there's like this little.

128
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,700
Fidelia Lam: like this little.

129
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:23,310
Fidelia Lam: bit that like doesn't really connect to the rest like in the way, so the other ones connect.

130
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:28,410
Fidelia Lam: I keep forgetting that little.

131
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,210
Fidelia Lam: Is that the timer.

132
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,600
Garrett Laroy Johnson: timer yeah.

133
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,620
Garrett Laroy Johnson: This is great.

134
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,200
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And in fact.

135
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,850
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So partially halfway through I also.

136
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,720
Garrett Laroy Johnson: As soon as I saw that logo I realized that I recognize that.

137
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:56,850
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Oh, I couldn't figure out where from it's it's on all of that, and finally, I was looking through seven PDF to try and find it I knew this from it from a journal, and then.

138
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,530
Fidelia Lam: right if i'm this journal.

139
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,340
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah right at the end you you you held it up and says perspectives of new views.

140
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:08,310
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And that's where it's from that's right record low out this is their logo yeah.

141
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,990
Fidelia Lam: that's that that's fascinating.

142
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,670
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I think it might be like a john cage doodle or something like.

143
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,900
Fidelia Lam: That.

144
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,380
honestly.

145
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,720
Garrett Laroy Johnson: awfully looking at this that's so funny I feel like I haven't seen that a long time either.

146
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:33,630
Fidelia Lam: yeah um something that curtis shared in right he shared like a sound pieces like a gift to the class because curtis right now is in.

147
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,250
Fidelia Lam: Idaho I don't know if you remember.

148
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,560
Fidelia Lam: curtis from hell it all.

149
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,290
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I remember his participation yeah.

150
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:57,120
Fidelia Lam: yeah and he so the class has been meeting in person, but curtis has been zooming in online and he gave us he, like shared this work kind of like intended as a gift to all of us in the classroom.

151
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:05,760
Fidelia Lam: which then it the peace of mind and be not just idle chatter by Paul in the yeah.

152
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:13,980
Fidelia Lam: which then led me to this interview and, like the idea of inner with simple things anyway i'm just rambling again, you want to look at me or keep looking at this page.

153
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,950
Garrett Laroy Johnson: that's up to you, I think.

154
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,180
Garrett Laroy Johnson: i'll give you the next prompt and you decide.

155
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,970
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I mean, maybe that will help you decide.

156
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,720
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So, first of all thank you.

157
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,530
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Thank you for that.

158
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,870
Fidelia Lam: you're welcome.

159
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:38,520
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So next we're going to repeat this with it a small difference.

160
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,490
Garrett Laroy Johnson: you'll still be asked to make.

161
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:47,970
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Some props some some things make some stuff.

162
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:56,370
Garrett Laroy Johnson: However, this time, instead of focusing on your own project you're asked to think of another project from slo mo.

163
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:04,440
Garrett Laroy Johnson: That you want to focus on and use those objects to speak with and about around that project.

164
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:15,840
Garrett Laroy Johnson: If something comes to mind, then we can go right away, otherwise we can also like look at the schedule and look in the proceedings, and maybe remind of some other work going on there.

165
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:32,490
Fidelia Lam: I mean what immediately came to mind was lydia's work and the work she was doing around pandemic infrastructures and then she was like annotating I think right if i'm remembering correctly, it has been a little bit, so I don't know if i'm remembering that right, but she was annotating.

166
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:37,170
Fidelia Lam: videos of pandemic infrastructures and.

167
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:46,590
Fidelia Lam: Their different movements I don't I don't know how much you are allowed to give the viewer can I like look that up or something.

168
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,500
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You can i'm all i'm also interested in like.

169
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,080
Garrett Laroy Johnson: it's impression on you.

170
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,250
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So.

171
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:58,410
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You know, you may you may look it up, if you like, you may also just speak about the impression.

172
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,690
Fidelia Lam: yeah I mean.

173
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:05,130
Fidelia Lam: yeah I really liked my cohort.

174
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:10,200
Fidelia Lam: And the work that like noon and.

175
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,810
Fidelia Lam: Oh i'm blanking on.

176
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:18,390
Fidelia Lam: coupon yeah the way that like bear.

177
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:25,980
Fidelia Lam: I yeah we all interconnected and like really interesting ways like we were all interested in kind of these different.

178
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:36,210
Fidelia Lam: paths and like ways of mapping and making and thinking that's like the drone sledding footage.

179
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:44,130
Fidelia Lam: But then, also the work that megan was doing around like different forms of play and i'm.

180
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:53,100
Fidelia Lam: attending to like part like not the space of the park with different objects there i'm like blanking right now and it's kind of bothering me.

181
00:21:53,100 --> 00:22:01,260
Fidelia Lam: Because, for me, I think the way that that relates back to like these weird paths and.

182
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:09,750
Fidelia Lam: In our connections I don't know there's something piquing my interest there.

183
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,180
Fidelia Lam: And I just supposed to keep making.

184
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,320
Garrett Laroy Johnson: you're invited to keep me.

185
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,190
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Let me tell you to do.

186
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:24,750

00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:29,460
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah I don't know if she's well I don't I don't do social media lots i'm not sure it's up to.

205
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:36,450
Fidelia Lam: me.

206
00:23:36,450 --> 00:24:03,600
Fidelia Lam: There is absolutely no logic to this.

207
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,370
Fidelia Lam: Did I do.

208
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:18,570
Fidelia Lam: Oh no, I have a thing, where i'm really bad at counting and keeping track of things in my head, so I don't know if that's everyone in my cohort that I drawn a weird symbol for.

209
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,000
Fidelia Lam: me.

210
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,130
Fidelia Lam: bree.

211
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:31,800
Fidelia Lam: Who can't tell which one is which because now it's all just become a mess, which is kind of what I wanted, but.

212
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,890
Fidelia Lam: Now I can't tell how many of them.

213
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:46,710
Fidelia Lam: You haven't happened to be counting 125.

214
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:51,840
Fidelia Lam: has done i'm just one more for good measure, why not.

215
00:24:51,840 --> 00:25:14,010
Fidelia Lam: And let's just make this one like really big.

216
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:23,220
Fidelia Lam: don't know what color or what.

217
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,190
Fidelia Lam: What else.

218
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,910
Fidelia Lam: Do.

219
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:33,960
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You have another five minutes.

220
00:25:33,960 --> 00:26:00,360
Fidelia Lam: cool.

221
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:21,240
Fidelia Lam: Why am I only using one side of the paper, I could also be using the other side of the paper.

222
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,980
Fidelia Lam: Am I allowed to ask what your dissertation is about right now, or.

223
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,200
Fidelia Lam: Is that a.

224
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,580
Fidelia Lam: conversation.

225
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,810
Garrett Laroy Johnson: We can chat about that afterwards i'm happy to do.

226
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:47,490
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I can, I think that's a valid question with respect to this experience so i'll speak to the role that that this has, in the in the dissertation i'm interested in how.

227
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:55,110
Garrett Laroy Johnson: i'm interested in developing techniques of convening, and this is related to gathering.

228
00:26:55,110 --> 00:27:08,040
Garrett Laroy Johnson: But convenient particular to the person so moko was a response to the pandemic, but also it's the top of other experiences bringing people together.

229
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:17,220
Garrett Laroy Johnson: which you know it sort of academic and intellectual cultures is that, as a kind of activity that's that's overlooked, sometimes.

230
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,750
Garrett Laroy Johnson: In particular here i'm interested in.

231
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:26,190
Garrett Laroy Johnson: What lingers after the event.

232
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:32,040
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And like how is how is what lingers also transformed through time.

233
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:41,820
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And what do we take with us and you know what what is what is lost what is generated by taking something like this with us.

234
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,320
yeah.

235
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:50,610
Fidelia Lam: Have you read, not to be like that academic person, but have you read the sentence time bye hon.

236
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,990
Fidelia Lam: i've been literally.

237
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:56,100
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Everyone about so funny even early today, but he talks about.

238
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,140
Fidelia Lam: Lingering in it.

239
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:05,550
Fidelia Lam: And there's one line or he says lingering as a gathering of the senses, which has been.

240
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,550
Fidelia Lam: hitting with a lot lately.

241
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:17,820
Garrett Laroy Johnson: that's really funny I I come into my my studio this morning, I meant to grab the burnout society.

242
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,820
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I do, and I forgot.

243
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:25,830
Garrett Laroy Johnson: But I have young children on the mind also.

244
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:30,660
Fidelia Lam: yeah when I was talking to Sean tall earlier.

245
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:36,510
Fidelia Lam: But.

246
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:44,730
Fidelia Lam: something about like the covers to connect back to like what noon and people on worship, like their.

247
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,880
Fidelia Lam: Work I don't know.

248
00:28:47,880 --> 00:29:05,580
Fidelia Lam: Well, so this is, this is the one that talks about lingering more but, but I think, for me it goes in conversation with the disappearance of rituals a lot, which seems connected to all of this, as well, I would love to hear you talk more about convening.

249
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,150
Fidelia Lam: I don't know how much time we have where again like.

250
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,870
Fidelia Lam: What is permissible or not right now.

251
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:13,590
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You have a couple.

252
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:19,740
Garrett Laroy Johnson: We have a couple man.

253
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,690
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah I don't know how to how to how to start this I mean.

254
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,480
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And also keep it bound the.

255
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,210
Garrett Laroy Johnson: problem, the dissertation.

256
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,610
Fidelia Lam: yeah.

257
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:36,180
Garrett Laroy Johnson: can be mean.

258
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,030
Garrett Laroy Johnson: convening is something which.

259
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:46,800
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Is a mode of hospitality right there's always you know if you go to conferences of course everybody is.

260
00:29:46,800 --> 00:30:02,370
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Always always thinking organizers busy know how much work it is and almost and you know if if the conference is done right how much karen's put into it as well, and so it becomes this it becomes a metric seo activity right.

261
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:13,350
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And so, for me, i'm interested in thinking about these kinds of gatherings as as laboratories for experimenting with collective knowledge production.

262
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,740
Garrett Laroy Johnson: How is it that that we come together and.

263
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:40,050
Garrett Laroy Johnson: and engage and collaborate in a way which is entirely an informal right, I mean the conference session itself, for instance, and you know we take it for granted, how can, how can we tool retool those in order to produce new modes and also more equitable modes.

264
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:49,950
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Producing knowledge collectively, you know, there are other questions here to you know, one of the micro politics of the Conference, where the micro politics of.

265
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,620
Garrett Laroy Johnson: collective knowledge production.

266
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,980
Fidelia Lam: yeah.

267
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:06,630
Fidelia Lam: That reminds or, again, I don't know if you remember Luke that he and I were chatting and I think he's trying to like either teach a course on hospitality or something.

268
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,360
Fidelia Lam: or like do something around that.

269
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,510
Fidelia Lam: Also because so his partner.

270
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:18,630
Fidelia Lam: peaches oh I forgot where but they're in Massachusetts right now, so their house in La is.

271
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,800
Fidelia Lam: has been.

272
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:27,690
Fidelia Lam: kind of vacant but apparently it's just been like artists and visitors rotating through that space and like they've.

273
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:36,540
Fidelia Lam: Created like they're using that house to create hospitality for like this artists.

274
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:40,410
Fidelia Lam: for artists and stuff which I think is super cool um.

275
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:46,770
Fidelia Lam: i've been thinking about fans a lot in the last couple of days and paper fans, specifically, which is why i'm.

276
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,390
Holding.

277
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,640
Fidelia Lam: This now.

278
00:31:50,640 --> 00:32:00,150
Fidelia Lam: weeks and folds and the lose and all that fun goodness.

279
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:19,260
Fidelia Lam: yeah there's like that to lose quote that's like i'm forever unfolding between two folds and if to perceive as to if to unfold, then I am forever unfolding between the phone or something like that it's from.

280
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:23,130
Fidelia Lam: From the book.

281
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,410
Fidelia Lam: and

282
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:31,380
Fidelia Lam: yeah I don't know i've always really loved that quote um.

283
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:37,680
Fidelia Lam: let's see what happened to our weird entangled tape I do.

284
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,780
Fidelia Lam: Again I don't know what i'm doing here.

285
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,850
Garrett Laroy Johnson: This is great.

286
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,790
Garrett Laroy Johnson: we're out of time, so if you want to.

287
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,450
Fidelia Lam: Okay.

288
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,990
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah just wrap it up, we can.

289
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:55,860
Garrett Laroy Johnson: We can move on, but looks like you've come to a really nice conclusion.

290
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:01,980
Which.

291
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,660
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Nice.

292
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,090
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So.

293
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:11,670
Fidelia Lam: I wonder yeah.

294
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:20,790
Garrett Laroy Johnson: It works.

295
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:27,750
Garrett Laroy Johnson: This is great Thank you so.

296
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:35,820
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, in the next five minutes, you know how these two products.

297
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:44,580
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And in five minutes i'd like to invite you to create a third prop or more which connect the two.

298
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,900
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You might think about this connecting the props materially.

299
00:33:48,900 --> 00:34:12,270
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And you might think about them connecting the props and what they encompass conception, technically, etc, etc, we believe the nature of connection open to you, but the task is to create a third or more products that connect.

300
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:15,690
Fidelia Lam: How long do I have.

301
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:21,990
Fidelia Lam: Okay, that is not enough time for what I originally had in mind.

302
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:25,410
Fidelia Lam: Or what like initially came to mind.

303
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:28,290
Fidelia Lam: Oh.

304
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,840
Fidelia Lam: Can you say that all one more time, no.

305
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:36,180
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Time crunch, but yeah No, of course, so you're asked.

306
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:46,680
Garrett Laroy Johnson: To create a third prop three or more, you might you might create a fourth and a fifth maybe you need to maybe you need 10 new products you're asked to make some new props.

307
00:34:46,680 --> 00:35:07,980
Garrett Laroy Johnson: That connect your two props the one that was your project and the one that was, like the other projects from your cohort those made those connections can be physical right, like you, like i'm connecting these two things in physical space, they can also be props that connect conceptually.

308
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:14,850
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Technically, and effectively politically geographically.

309
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,250
Garrett Laroy Johnson: etc, etc.

310
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:21,330
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Does that help.

311
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:25,260
Fidelia Lam: I mean, I know what i'm being asked to do, but.

312
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,310
Fidelia Lam: doing it.

313
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:30,510
Fidelia Lam: For like knowing what to do is.

314
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,870
Fidelia Lam: Another question okay.

315
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:42,660
Fidelia Lam: let's see any of the random things in here.

316
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:51,060
Fidelia Lam: Some stuff happens.

317
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:55,590
Fidelia Lam: And all these fun things I found in my room.

318
00:35:55,590 --> 00:36:06,210
Fidelia Lam: Which is the most obvious connected thing but it's tangled so we'll see how long it takes me to untangle This, for me, I just cut it.

319
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,910
Fidelia Lam: I think i'd like two minutes left.

320
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:16,500
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You have.

321
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,160
Fidelia Lam: To do was.

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,590
Fidelia Lam: figure out a way to.

323
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:29,100
Fidelia Lam: Because there's like these little balls and I wanted to like I wonder if.

324
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:37,050
Fidelia Lam: This is like less fun, I wanted to make like a 3D version of of this logo.

325
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,030
Fidelia Lam: Like spatially.

326
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,620
Fidelia Lam: But I don't know if that's going to happen so we're gonna.

327
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:52,860
Fidelia Lam: use some of these balls and I don't know if you can like orient ooh it'll be interesting to see if you can orient yourself.

328
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:57,030
Fidelia Lam: In relation to.

329
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:03,330
Fidelia Lam: Maybe we just leave everything, where it is.

330
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:03,990
Fidelia Lam: If.

331
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:09,240

00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:34,740
Fidelia Lam: This cuts across to.

335
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:38,940
Fidelia Lam: It goes down.

336
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,360
Fidelia Lam: And I don't know what i'm doing.

337
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,830

442
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:06,750
Garrett Laroy Johnson: super.

443
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:09,420
Fidelia Lam: fun.

444
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,990
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Thank you.

445
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:22,920
Fidelia Lam: And I don't know what's happening, but that's part of the fun.

446
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,190
Fidelia Lam: actually quite like this collection of objects.

447
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:30,270
Garrett Laroy Johnson: awesome do you want to introduce them to the.

448
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:33,900
Garrett Laroy Johnson: For us now poster poster collection.

449
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:44,760
Fidelia Lam: um I mean I don't know if it's like unnecessarily one to one correlation in terms of the words that you gave me, I mean this one, the.

450
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,070
Fidelia Lam: The miran.

451
00:47:47,070 --> 00:48:03,540
Fidelia Lam: Was the Chairwoman like thought, but then also I don't know there is something like about the vessel or like the container of pure like the mirin that something about the word gentlemen felt like a.

452
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:12,720
Fidelia Lam: container or maybe that's just because he said it was an instrument I don't know if that's like specifically what I intended or thought about interesting.

453
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,820
Fidelia Lam: This.

454
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:23,850
Fidelia Lam: is just on our coffee table, but there's a very happy plan by our window that sometimes.

455
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:25,830
Fidelia Lam: um.

456
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:35,010
Fidelia Lam: And then that little cactus that which, like the Bamboo and basil it's interesting that Bamboo is also.

457
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:37,980
Fidelia Lam: Like actively thought about.

458
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:44,190
Fidelia Lam: To do something to have a gas for that we think about sorry.

459
00:48:44,190 --> 00:49:05,580
Fidelia Lam: Oh, like quotation in terms of like planting seeds Okay, like the way could put quotation marks around Bamboo and then the seed planting that we've already talked about actually waiting seed potentials kind of what's the process for when you like propagate plans is it just propagating.

460
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,020
Fidelia Lam: yeah yeah.

461
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,790
Fidelia Lam: Like propagation.

462
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:10,890
Fidelia Lam: As like a form of quotation.

463
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:14,280
Fidelia Lam: And then also this like cactus bits that I took off.

464
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:22,980
Fidelia Lam: For that I like took from the roof is you know from a bigger cactus cacti cactus.

465
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,010
Fidelia Lam: Anyway, that's Those are all my random thoughts.

466
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:27,180
Garrett Laroy Johnson: This is great.

467
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,390
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And you're you're so so thank you for getting this you're.

468
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:49,290
Garrett Laroy Johnson: anticipating a bit, I think this final prompt so so now you have three new problems with new new props you also have your old props from before, so I want you to put yourself, or I invite you to put yourself in a new place where.

469
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:59,880
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You bring all of these props into the room with you and they're now your conceptual material vocabulary.

470
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,000
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Here in 10 minutes.

471
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:12,450
Garrett Laroy Johnson: you're invited to propose a new stream of work, a new research question.

472
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:24,270
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Using these props a new artistic exploration, a new area I am purposely making that vague and sort of.

473
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:34,410
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Making a large Delta, so you can sort of explore where you would like to go, but the idea is that these props can prop up.

474
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:37,320
Garrett Laroy Johnson: A new something new.

475
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:45,930
Garrett Laroy Johnson: That maybe hasn't come up in conversation or has come up in conversation but hasn't sort of coalesced into.

476
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:51,840
Garrett Laroy Johnson: hasn't coalesced into you know something concrete that would be done.

477
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,630
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You may.

478
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:58,020
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Think of this as broadly as you like.

479
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:01,230
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You also don't have to.

480
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:04,800
Garrett Laroy Johnson: ever do this project.

481
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,230
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So you know.

482
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:18,210
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Maybe you want to just get something out of your system or or you know, maybe you want to do something really grand right like the 3D model of the.

483
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:24,120
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Of the drawing, for instance, is a have I explained this clearly.

484
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,700
Fidelia Lam: I think so, but can you do it one more time.

485
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:44,880
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah sure so in 10 minutes and you'll use the props that you've made and the ones that you've just gathered in order to talk through a new project, something which you propose right now in real time.

486
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,910
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Using the.

487
00:51:47,910 --> 00:52:03,030
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Using the concepts that are attached to these perhaps are using the materiality of these in order to articulate what the stakes might be of this of this project that you would undertake.

488
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:05,670
Fidelia Lam: Okay.

489
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:10,920
Fidelia Lam: Any questions about that I don't think so.

490
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,070
Fidelia Lam: um.

491
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:15,780
Fidelia Lam: This is what.

492
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:29,790
Fidelia Lam: First, came to mind so i'm you can't really see but i'll narrate i'm making the logo with the dots again, but much bigger on my floor.

493
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:40,260
Fidelia Lam: And I cut keep coming back to the word entanglement and i'm running into the spark heart now.

494
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:46,980
Fidelia Lam: What do I do with the spark heart here it's.

495
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:52,800
Fidelia Lam: going to go on the market.

496
00:52:52,800 --> 00:53:02,880
Fidelia Lam: I picked up so many orange ones.

497
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,110
Fidelia Lam: That.

498
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:21,870
Fidelia Lam: I mean, I think the logo also reminds me reminds me of like a labyrinth path in a way, also maybe with like how i've been tracing it in terms of like the ritual of walking a labyrinth right and now i'm for some reason i'm walking this path.

499
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:25,530
Fidelia Lam: um and.

500
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:41,730
Fidelia Lam: What I wanted to, I guess, I can't walk into the bar carpet.

501
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:43,980
Fidelia Lam: here.

502
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:49,650
Fidelia Lam: And I wanted to place the objects, they need.

503
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:54,300
Fidelia Lam: snakes ball is she paper that I don't think I showed you.

504
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,030
Fidelia Lam: I started this this.

505
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:05,190
Fidelia Lam: Is it always to be illogical is time always linear I think this path, would say no, but.

506
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:07,950
Fidelia Lam: But you appear.

507
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:15,690
Fidelia Lam: Man that's a string was technically a prop maybe we put the string on the barker's.

508
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:22,380
Fidelia Lam: This is gonna be fun to document later.

509
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:29,700
Fidelia Lam: This one and, like how do I show you what is happening.

510
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,040
Fidelia Lam: To carry.

511
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:49,230
Garrett Laroy Johnson: A plan.

512
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:53,160
Fidelia Lam: Please don't like accidentally step on this later it's pretty big.

513
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,420
Fidelia Lam: But.

514
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:57,390
Fidelia Lam: um okay.

515
00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:03,000
Fidelia Lam: um and I guess what initially came to mind when you were.

516
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,720
Fidelia Lam: giving me the prompt was like.

517
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:16,740
Fidelia Lam: I don't know there's something about like the process of tracing of propagation of.

518
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:35,280
Fidelia Lam: I guess like with the fan and surface and, like my dissertation thinking you know thinking and the the Mirren thinking about globalization and like cultural not only exchange, but like pathways of power i'm also.

519
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,760
Fidelia Lam: yeah like the way that.

520
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:44,100
Fidelia Lam: America is a country, you know is constituted on.

521
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:51,300
Fidelia Lam: Who is considered American which is you know within a white nationalist context, most of the time.

522
00:55:51,300 --> 00:56:00,390
Fidelia Lam: And how I think these objects, in a way, speak to like the excesses of that.

523
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:05,040
Fidelia Lam: Of that subjectivity of like how there's always something that exceeds.

524
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,620
Fidelia Lam: The norm, or like the.

525
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:12,960
Fidelia Lam: Self voice requires the other blah blah blah.

526
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,990
Fidelia Lam: that's also now recorded cool.

527
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:21,990
Fidelia Lam: um so that's kind of where my thinking is.

528
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:26,550
Fidelia Lam: In terms of like a actual project.

529
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:35,760
Fidelia Lam: I don't know there's also something interesting about like the fact that I didn't move the bar cart.

530
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:43,470
Fidelia Lam: But the bark right does move I don't know how much time I have you want to see what I.

531
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,030
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Have about five minutes with you don't have.

532
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:48,330
Garrett Laroy Johnson: time to time, if you don't want to, but yeah I do want to see.

533
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:57,510
Fidelia Lam: I don't think I mean I can just like keep rambling for five minutes, but we started here again sorry my apartments messy.

534
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:04,200
Fidelia Lam: And then the sluice the one dot and then we can hear and then this is like the little Can you see, I don't know okay.

535
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:18,480
Fidelia Lam: yeah and then we go to the fam the has our nice folded colored things back down, and then we go on to the burkhardt there's.

536
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,050
Fidelia Lam: Those fluffy things the dot.

537
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:24,510
Fidelia Lam: The streaming.

538
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:29,880
Fidelia Lam: And then we come back this way to the.

539
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:38,310
Fidelia Lam: This thing and then down to the Miriam and then over here to the cacti, why is the last.

540
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:39,900
Fidelia Lam: I don't know.

541
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:49,140
Fidelia Lam: I don't think this is like where the drawing ends necessarily but.

542
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:54,180
Fidelia Lam: that's where the doodle ended.

543
00:57:54,180 --> 00:58:00,150
Fidelia Lam: yeah.

544
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:01,920
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah.

545
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:07,410
Garrett Laroy Johnson: No, I think this is great, thank you for the oh yeah.

546
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:11,730
Garrett Laroy Johnson: This is awesome so.

547
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:23,670
Garrett Laroy Johnson: There are two small section for just a book on this first of all, you inherited some.

548
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:39,750
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Proper names prompts from somebody else and it's now your turn to pass on some prompts to somebody else so among the props either that you gather, it could be reused from from what you inherited.

549
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:48,990
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Or the ones that you brought to the table, what do you want to pass on to the next interview even.

550
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:52,380
Fidelia Lam: Like as prompts for they're making right.

551
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,270
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah so they won't see the images.

552
00:58:54,270 --> 00:59:00,210
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Will just hear the hear and see and read the words.

553
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:12,180
Fidelia Lam: seems like a good one.

554
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:25,980
Fidelia Lam: I don't know I suddenly have no vocabulary.

555
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:29,130
Fidelia Lam: entanglement to.

556
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:31,860
Fidelia Lam: Too much okay.

557
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:34,770
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You did.

558
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:37,320
Fidelia Lam: and

559
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,600
Fidelia Lam: stairs.

560
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:48,930
Fidelia Lam: Because I was reading was Giuliana bro Bruno buck, and there was a section about stairs and cinema and then also you and I went up some stairs today and also down some.

561
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:55,170
Fidelia Lam: stairs as a passage between which seems fitting for like passing on anyway.

562
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:56,700
Fidelia Lam: don't need to philosophize everything.

563
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,160
Okay.

564
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:03,150
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Thank you, this is awesome these are great prompts.

565
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:10,200
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah I mean there's a lot going on here, I appreciate it.

566
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:18,000
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So that's it the only other thing is i'm just gonna ask you to take some photos of these and send them to me.

567
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,230
Garrett Laroy Johnson: How do you send them to me, you can just reply to my email, if you want.

568
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:32,040
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Otherwise it'll it'll if you can it helps you organize this a little bit if you can submit them.

569
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:42,630
Garrett Laroy Johnson: In this form maturity, for you, basically just update your information, very and you should be able to submit the photos if that works great if it doesn't just email them to me no problem.

570
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:44,760
Fidelia Lam: Right and.

571
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:47,160
Fidelia Lam: photos and things do you want.

Garrett Laroy Johnson: As many as you as many as you want to get honestly.

573
01:00:52,320 --> 01:01:07,050
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You know if it's one per prop that's fine if you are feeling photographic you can go crazy as well and yeah totally totally while out.

574
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:11,730
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah, the last thing is, I just want to make sure I have your.
