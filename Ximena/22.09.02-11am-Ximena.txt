prop 1 // old papers and manuscripts to create a breathing apparatus

 --> 
lungs --> accordian --> fire stoker w. leather (bellows)
accordianed paper --> is breathing 
Pauline Oliveros bookmark 

technology w. postdoctoral training?

lack of control, paper is controllable 
--> sonification --> 
breathing as a feedback for others and themselves 

walking and breathing --> migration 
interface?  

prop 2 // compass 
N W E S --> circle but not in this moment 
connected me to earth; 

what connects her to the sky? to the stars? 
naturally good at orienting to the earth; needs a way to orient to the sky? 

at slomoco: language, body, voice -- could be very rational. dream as irrational mode, sky as a mysterious space, a space beyond the control. 

what is an evolution of the project -- what do I want to connect to and why?

planting trees -- created happiness. as a migrant planting a tree, related to migrant discourse with roots. firm but gentle. don't show too much of the root. close off the air. 

walking as a pose 

-- fragility strength 


time: 11.28
part 3. other project // compundanzas by sejo //
prop 2: drawing of people dancing, 
bottom is timeline 
on the left off the the corner is the box of the computer 
people are forefronted 

technology as locked in a box 
a sense of freedom and playfulness, humorous, 
a sense of organization, a reliance on human ability to imitate; 

rhythm 
togetherness 

rhythm lesson in school: 
start with chalk to write a rhythm, 
then erase --> 
connection to steps

the coordinatation of a mysterious code, like children's secret language 

11:38 // Synthesis
prop name: tuning, tune-in, 3 and more-ways of the tuning 
step upon mirror world, distant parts of the planet, establish a connection which is more than synchronization 

*added headphones* attunement devices, attune to the rhythm of themselves, attune to someone else, attune to things that are sounding where they are. produces a new kind of sense. 

11:46 // props from before, synthesis setup 
Gathering, 
paper cut from manuscripts 


Practice, 
folded origami 


Questions  
color strips, 4 lines, with different colors
the process of reading and relating

11:55 
Synthesis: proposing a new project // 

playing with the materiality without even thiking
took glue, accordian, drawn to flexibility --- gathering things are gathered with the glue on the accordian. like a place where the fragments will be go. 

cut page with the color lines. put it accross the "instrument" 
 
made it rounded, compass -- the moon is a bit out now. 

the origami needs to be free; 

produced
Three objects 
1. most physical. bellows + color + gathering, easy to grasp. 
a wearable, what we need to wear. not leather, not cardboard --- everyday, recyclable. mobiles as bricks --> towards a flexibility, reminded of conversation with HCI researcher. ephemoral but connected. flexible object  (interface) as connector between people. 


2. virtual // guides compass 
---dreaming part -- dreaming with sunset colors, ethereal sunset; in the imagination 

connector when no tech is needed, when people are dreaming together.

3. ? // practice 
--> connected to tree. a physical object that is emplaced, fixed in location. 

this is when people are rooted.

4. people in distant locations moving with joy 

^ these are understood by people 

part 7: passing on (to Teoma Nacarrato). 

1. Bellow-Fuelle, Fuelle-Bellow; 
2. 3 and more ways of tuning; 
3. question mark.
