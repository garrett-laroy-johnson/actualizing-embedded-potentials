1
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:11,400
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And so megan is just given consent to record so about recording and if, at any time, you want to want me to stop recording.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,210
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You are free to let me know, and I will stop recording.

3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:25,590
Garrett Laroy Johnson: As well your participation in general is voluntary, so if you choose not to participate or withdraw from the study of anytime there's no penalty, you can simply walk away.

4
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:36,330
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And i'm going to ask our invite your participation and over the course of about 15 minutes, I asked you to speak, I asked you to make some things.

5
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:44,520
Garrett Laroy Johnson: and constructing props and so on, are you have the right now to answer any of these questions, you have the right to stop participating at any time.

6
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:57,300
Garrett Laroy Johnson: always to you're always empowered to refuse and you also receive 2525 us bucks for participating, and then we can sort some of the details about that afterwards.

7
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:08,550
Garrett Laroy Johnson: But i'll send it to you, right after the session and yeah you must be at you must have submitted your work at slo mo I think both of those things are correct.

8
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:16,380
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And yeah another another thing about what will be what we'll do with this data so there'll be video collected, obviously.

9
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:37,710
Garrett Laroy Johnson: As well there'll be some photographs of props that i'll ask you to make and so these will be used to inform my dissertation and subsequent publication research, and so they may be pictured in those in those formats and there are no foreseeable risks or discomforts to your participation.

10
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:53,160
Garrett Laroy Johnson: About anonymity, by default, nothing that you say will be considered anonymous However, you may always indicate clearly to me that that one thing that you want to say should be off the record, or should be anonymous.

11
00:01:53,160 --> 00:02:10,140
Garrett Laroy Johnson: By extension, you may you may simply indicate to me that you want to be referred to anonymously throughout that is up to you and yeah so the those sorts of statements may be used in other reports vcs presentations or publications.

12
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,840
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Any questions about that.

13
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:25,530
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, thank you for for hearing that through okay so so then we're going to get started So what is this going to look like and like I said it's about a 15 minute process.

14
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:39,120
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And it's broken down into it's about five or six parts, depending on how you look at it, there are chunks of time which are about 10 minutes some or five minutes and.

15
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:58,650
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So each of these i'll start with a prompt and then the time will be yours and you're invited to speak you don't have to speak, you can be quiet you're invited to speak i'm interested in hearing what you have to say that will be helpful, but also invited to make things during this time.

16
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,020
Garrett Laroy Johnson: more about that specifically in the second.

17
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:21,840
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah I won't give you like a one minute warning just also since we're low on time i'll drop that into the chat So you can see Okay, I have one minutes left you're not obligated to take all the time, if at any point say that's all I have to say about that that's fine, we can we want.

18
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:35,430
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Any questions about the wide scale format yeah cool and So the first thing we want to do is just get a prepare our workstations and get our get our gear ready.

19
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:50,190
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So for this you're going to need a workspace a desk of some kind, and also some some things to work with, so these can be everyday objects things that you just have on your deaths already, and they can also be.

20
00:03:50,190 --> 00:04:02,070
Garrett Laroy Johnson: more constructive object security paper markers scissors tape pens and pencils etc, do you have those ready or you need some time to grab those.

21
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,540
Megan Young: I have lots of things.

22
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:12,390
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Great and then finally you'll just be asked to do some photographs of the end so if you have a smartphone or something like that, then you should be all set up.

23
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,630
Megan Young: And and yeah if I.

24
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,580
Megan Young: yep okay.

25
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,900
Megan Young: You don't have to watch me taking photographs, do you.

26
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,860
Garrett Laroy Johnson: don't.

27
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,350
Megan Young: That was just a little challenge for them, it was great.

28
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,700
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah no i'll will end the end the end the zoom call and i'll ask you to.

29
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,810
Garrett Laroy Johnson: send them over to me through the Google form.

30
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:43,200
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, great so for our first session for the first block we have 10 minutes maximum and you're invited to make a set of props.

31
00:04:43,200 --> 00:05:00,900
Garrett Laroy Johnson: This set of props should be markers they shouldn't body they should represent it should have some relationship to your project that you presented at slo mo co and i'm interested or I invite you to.

32
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:18,480
Garrett Laroy Johnson: To speak aloud to think about as you're as you're doing this process, maybe one thing, maybe this object works for this maybe it reminds you of something else, and this is, this does not need to be like a conference style presentation, or anything like that i'm not interested in.

33
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:26,100
Garrett Laroy Johnson: In Polish i'm just interested in why this is important to you and how you're making sense of it with these objects this morning.

34
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,910
Megan Young: Okay.

35
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,380
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Any questions about that.

36
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,000
Megan Young: necessarily.

37
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,880
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You can also ask well, while we're going if something comes up.

38
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:49,920
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And you're free to free to do that i'll mostly during these are mostly just like take a backseat take some notes, but I might pop in with like a follow up or something like that to clarify something so.

39
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,340
Garrett Laroy Johnson: If there's no questions, then let's get started.

40
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,600
Okay.

41
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Megan Young: Well i'm making props that relate to the work I presented at some elbow and right and what I had to do first was start to think about the work I presented.

42
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:17,460
Megan Young: to remind myself because it's been some time and the work has shifted since, so I was like okay let's scituate in my brain where I started.

43
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,140
Megan Young: And so I started think about maps, because I was really looking at.

44
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:28,890
Megan Young: Like last spring, when I was presenting and doing the micro residency.

45
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:36,780
Megan Young: We signed stealing I was presenting I was presenting I was looking at conversations around.

46
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,630
Megan Young: drums and how they.

47
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:51,030
Megan Young: engage virtuality and then how persons do and I did some work in comparison and comparison of those two days, so I was like okay that might be what i'm making.

48
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,080
Megan Young: i'm I can make those no.

49
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,080
Megan Young: Oh, and then yeah so I, I have a home space.

50
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,120
Megan Young: So I will be working with.

51
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,300
Megan Young: glitter Plato.

52
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,420
Megan Young: and pipe cleaners.

53
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,990
Megan Young: Just what I grabs.

54
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:21,330
Megan Young: which actually works out well.

55
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:34,200
Megan Young: And then I might and I don't actually know if I can do this because I had my background for a class I was teaching, but if if I show objects and you can't see them and i'll just put in front of you face but i'm.

56
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,780
Megan Young: i'm showing you something I don't know if I can take that background off while i'm in call you might know that.

57
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,740
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You can do that.

58
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:47,130
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You think you could do that if you want also it's kind of a cool effect that you show the subject to.

59
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,630
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Whatever you like to do.

60
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,990
Garrett Laroy Johnson: i'm enjoying this.

61
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,680
Megan Young: I just described me I was like oh yeah that's still on there.

62
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,480
Megan Young: yeah also it's interesting because the background is from a different day, you know how some backgrounds or.

63
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,970
Megan Young: mood specific.

64
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,740
Megan Young: Not today.

65
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,560
Megan Young: So props Okay, we are are things and then.

66
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:19,860
Megan Young: Some of the conversations around this project that came up where nuance and specificity and the way that.

67
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,140
Megan Young: Especially ario aerial.

68
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,980
Megan Young: footage.

69
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:32,160
Megan Young: But then also just technological imagery produces nuance and specificity doesn't always meet the.

70
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:43,170
Megan Young: value systems of humans on the ground, and so there is this conversation about value systems of image making in our mapping and.

71
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:47,970
Megan Young: Questions about human vs drone mapping.

72
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:55,680
Megan Young: So I guess it's good that i'm not drawing because I don't think there's going to be any degree of specificity going on here, but I have fuzzy objects.

73
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:10,530
Megan Young: squishy objects which is pleasing at this point, so I guess I did a lot of my project in downtown Cleveland but then recently i've been doing a lot more in neighborhoods so you're actually going to get a neighborhood map.

74
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:16,230
Megan Young: which I guess was just a leader development lots of.

75
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,550
Megan Young: imagery around schools.

76
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,930
Megan Young: And crosswalks.

77
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,470
Megan Young: and

78
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,300
Megan Young: i'm.

79
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:38,940
Megan Young: pathways yeah tons of pathways in the project, and this notion about following and what it means.

80
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:52,230
Megan Young: In surveillance clearly but also just personally like how weird is it to follow people around everywhere um what is the intention of that action and When does it get.

81
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,980
Megan Young: Extra creepy.

82
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:06,180
Megan Young: In the project, they talked a lot about like is following different depending on who is doing the following like if it was a superhero if it was a friend of yours, if it was a relationship person.

83
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:19,770
Megan Young: Or the state and I actually in the project didn't talk I didn't mention the state a lot, except for sort of an introducing some of the reason for the project, but it was implied.

84
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,870
Megan Young: So is this.

85
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:34,380
Megan Young: image mapping following happening by somebody you know by somebody you admire by some hero figure or by a power structure.

86
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,190
Megan Young: To show you my prop is becoming itself.

87
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:43,680
Megan Young: Sure, I don't know how many of you have seen it, but it looks like a dog right now.

88
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,810
Megan Young: But you know, like.

89
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,290
Megan Young: Okay.

90
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:58,080
Megan Young: yeah.

91
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:12,510
Megan Young: yeah so I during the springs the mobile I presented some of these tests on map mapping human and draw mapping and then I had a lot of karmic.

92
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:31,860
Megan Young: semi performative conversations around these ideas and, especially, an interactive responsive opportunity for people to share and and, in some cases implicate themselves and persons in their lives, I asked questions like.

93
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:39,630
Megan Young: Are there any physical barriers that would stop you if you were following somebody and then ask people to answer allowed.

94
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:54,390
Megan Young: There was a series of questions I titled poetical profiling that I have since presented in a variety of formats in person and online.

95
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,060
Megan Young: Let me know if I answered your.

96
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,110
Megan Young: yeah so I have created prep doesn't need to be preps plural.

97
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:07,380
Garrett Laroy Johnson: look to you I think you're invited to make more if you feel compelled to.

98
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,790
Garrett Laroy Johnson: But you have just so you know you have about four minutes left.

99
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:16,170
Garrett Laroy Johnson: In the in the Max.

100
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,290
Megan Young: i'm just thinking about what else may be.

101
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,550
Megan Young: relevant to the work that I was presenting.

102
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,590
Megan Young: um.

103
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:31,500
Megan Young: yeah I can make some figures.

104
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,850
Megan Young: So, like.

105
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:49,020
Megan Young: As the project progressed throughout somewhat the summer, but especially just an individual practice i'm really considering how humans people form ideas of distance perspective.

106
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,290
Megan Young: and

107
00:12:52,290 --> 00:13:00,150
Megan Young: threat like how notions of were a threat is or how its formed are kind of constructed in.

108
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,910
Megan Young: In space i'm.

109
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,180
Megan Young: really looking a lot into.

110
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:15,660
Megan Young: How much of our relationship with with space and distance relates to our bodies notions of like get really geeky about words and language.

111
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:37,140
Megan Young: And the pace and the music passes as a mile and these ideas about the body, giving us some sense of where we are in the world and giving you a sense of how the world is structured and then how especially I mean really all surveillance and fixed point mechanical imagery but.

112
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:46,170
Megan Young: Especially as aerial surveillance and this capturing have a have a perspective that I think humans have yet to.

113
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:52,650
Megan Young: acknowledge is, this is a new plane and but then it's still being used.

114
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,260
Megan Young: Some ways.

115
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,990
Megan Young: To define.

116
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:02,610
Megan Young: Like ethical boundaries and things like that, even though we don't fully understand.

117
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:08,430
Megan Young: So i'm just making little people on the ground, and then I think i'll make a drone.

118
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,450
Garrett Laroy Johnson: sounds great.

119
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:26,400
Megan Young: I don't know to scale i'm not sure they're people they might be houses.

120
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,010
Megan Young: And then I wish I had something like.

121
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:35,850
Megan Young: And I don't have any shops nearby we'll see maybe when I photograph it will have an install.

122
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:43,500
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah you're welcome you're welcome to also set aside the photographs.

123
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,360
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Are you have about a minute.

124
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,820
Megan Young: Okay, I mean i'm.

125
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,650
Megan Young: just finishing my little journey here, which I think is going to be.

126
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,330
Megan Young: Complete.

127
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,400
Garrett Laroy Johnson: awesome.

128
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,470
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Let me move on.

129
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,850
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Great.

130
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,040
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Thank you for that.

131
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:27,090
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, great so the next part is going to repeat the process what we've just done will do again, except that instead of taking your own project as a subject you'll take somebody else's project from some local this can be any presentation from in any category.

132
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:37,740
Garrett Laroy Johnson: If something comes to mind you're free to go with that there's no pressure for choosing Likewise, if you need a refresher we can look at the proceedings or something like that.

133
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,180
Megan Young: um I have one that comes to mind I just forgot the last name of one of those.

134
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,540
Megan Young: presenters Nina starting ella and sell a.

135
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,480
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Service widen.

136
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,970
Garrett Laroy Johnson: As I think it's pronounced widen widen SWAT IDA.

137
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,140
Megan Young: Thank you.

138
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,460
Megan Young: yeah i'm.

139
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:01,320
Megan Young: engaged with their workshop and.

140
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:07,170
Megan Young: Honestly, even just that experience of engaging their workshop, thank you for this really.

141
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:17,580
Megan Young: kind of like stuck in my mind as we co participated in other events and proceedings, you know, like having some of those workshop conversations felt like it bleed into.

142
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:25,350
Megan Young: notes and comments from other presentations so their project was looking at touch.

143
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:35,010
Megan Young: At least, and I don't remember the definition of their their workshop but i'm in my definition we were exploring touch through.

144
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,110
Megan Young: mediated.

145
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:41,430
Megan Young: And synchronous but.

146
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:51,510
Megan Young: Non vocational spaces, so you know, through the zoom calls and meetings and they had us exploring touch within our own environments.

147
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:59,310
Megan Young: And I am saying this for myself, but please let me know if i'm like missing anything that you want to pass in but i'm.

148
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:12,450
Megan Young: Also, that was that was one of the presentations that most least we relied on visual ality and I appreciated that so there was times when there was intentional turning off of the video.

149
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:24,210
Megan Young: visuals even maybe if audio remain and so looking at conversations through audio only and how did that increase intimacy and connection or not um.

150
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:28,890
Megan Young: And surfaces and it it.

151
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:37,860
Megan Young: Full disclosure, it was most interesting to me because it relates really closely first to some past work I had done in that area, but then also even.

152
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:46,620
Megan Young: grounding me in this conversation about, as I was saying, like, how do we judge distance and how is the body involved and how is the body central.

153
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:52,200
Megan Young: So yeah OK, so now i'm making props of their workshop.

154
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Megan Young: Yes, this will be fun okay.

155
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,520
Megan Young: I picked the right materials.

156
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,140
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You just knew.

157
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,430
Megan Young: Well yeah.

158
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:09,540
Megan Young: And I mean you know their work was exciting to me because.

159
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,770
Megan Young: It just it extend some of my own interests in the world.

160
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,780
Megan Young: um.

161
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,320
Megan Young: I also really appreciate.

162
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:26,820
Megan Young: Like professionally their aesthetic and their ability to pair a seemingly.

163
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,520
Megan Young: rough unfinished or.

164
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:37,140
Megan Young: Raw aesthetic with what is actually a high level of Polish and so that's like a just a professional like I.

165
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:47,670
Megan Young: I love when I just continued that is one of my maybe areas that I struggle with or you know internally struggle with so i'm.

166
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:53,760
Megan Young: All of their records just really nicely compose well being raw.

167
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:05,850
Megan Young: um.

168
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,610
Megan Young: Oh okay I should show you so.

169
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,870
Megan Young: touch surface and.

170
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,700
Megan Young: All the things I was mentioning I have these like.

171
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,680
Megan Young: they're actually finger pressed cookie shape.

172
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,330
Megan Young: Things that are starting to also look like butts, which I appreciate.

173
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:35,580
Megan Young: But I made one that doesn't look like a but it might look like headphones actually.

174
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,170
Megan Young: And then i'm going to do some connections through those.

175
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,190
Megan Young: finger press cookies with my.

176
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,520
Megan Young: pipe cleaners, so this is us across.

177
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,150
Megan Young: across the country.

178
00:19:51,150 --> 00:20:09,840
Megan Young: Touching our headphone butts on the surfaces.

179
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,760
Megan Young: And then, when I send you photos I will not be sending you these descriptions that's cool right.

180
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,620
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah absolutely i'm taking notes.

181
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,820
Megan Young: Well, I figured I mean you.

182
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,690
Garrett Laroy Johnson: should be.

183
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:27,990
yeah.

184
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:33,690
Megan Young: So am I going to end up making you said, there are five or six sections are we going to be looking at five or six.

185
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,570
Megan Young: sets of prop.

186
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:40,500
Garrett Laroy Johnson: No, not necessarily regarding.

187
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:55,410
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Oh there's going to be let's see you're going to make two more sets of props that will be yeah you'll make two more sets of props and then you'll do a sort of.

188
00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:01,170
Garrett Laroy Johnson: human nature thing that that doesn't necessarily involve making more props, but it could.

189
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,920
Megan Young: just looking at quantity of materials and if I need to gather more.

190
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,860
Megan Young: Sure yeah.

191
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,610
Megan Young: Alright, so my pipe cleaners are getting feet.

192
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,820
Megan Young: But they don't have any other body reference.

193
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:20,160
Megan Young: These are their feet.

194
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:35,820
Megan Young: And some of their feet they're talking under my little prints so they might not be visible on camera.

195
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:41,970
Megan Young: And you have the proceedings for the title of their session I did forget that did I get it right.

196
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:49,920
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Let me find.

197
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,990
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So all the fall.

198
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,870
yeah.

199
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,420
Megan Young: spring 21.

200
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,380
Megan Young: I think they did you I think they did another one in the.

201
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,820
Megan Young: fall, maybe.

202
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:26,880
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Not all.

203
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,070
Megan Young: completed my.

204
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:33,240
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Wonderful.

205
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:41,940
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I can't find this immediately so i'm gonna pivot my attention back oh wow.

206
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,870
Megan Young: The map is right next to it, there we go.

207
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:50,160
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I love this effect with the screen background.

208
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,520
Right.

209
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,450
Garrett Laroy Johnson: i'm going to use this shit don't you worry.

210
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,520
Garrett Laroy Johnson: This is material.

211
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:09,930
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay Thank you so much, this is great alright, so now you have a cup of tea, you have actually these props next to each other, now.

212
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:24,990
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And in five minutes in five minutes, I would like to invite you to think about the connection between these projects you've already spoken to some of these.

213
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:36,000
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I like to invite you to connect to make some connective props and then to speak and to name these connected props as you go, what are the connections between them.

214
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:50,220
Garrett Laroy Johnson: How are they connected what is not connected, you can speak to all and and this all of this, and more, and we know that, if you like, as well, does that make sense.

215
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,700
Megan Young: yeah.

216
00:23:50,700 --> 00:24:00,750
Megan Young: i'm just already thinking about what i'm going to do so, what are the connections with me is which I spoke on a little bit i'm doing that visually in connective prep I might need more Plato.

217
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:06,180
Megan Young: And i'm starting to notice that, aside from the drone I might take the drone back because all of the like human element of become.

218
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:10,590
Megan Young: squishy materials so i'm going to read the drone actually.

219
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:19,470
Megan Young: um so that it's not in Plato, because not understand that that's that's becoming like body for me like squishy stuff.

220
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:33,090
Megan Young: um Okay, so I was reading my ascot for goodness knows why i'm telematics embrace and I was starting to be like, yes, so you know this notion that.

221
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:37,320
Megan Young: Intelligence isn't that much different in cattle up.

222
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,530
Megan Young: computational medium than you know how it is.

223
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:44,820
Megan Young: In our bodies, but that the difference is moist.

224
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:56,070
Megan Young: And I just i'm just going to hold on to that as the connectivity between our two projects that moisture so if recreated the drone it now has a new forms, and it is unvoiced.

225
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:05,730
Megan Young: As I think it's appropriate Okay, so we fix that and then i'm going to get some more Plato, because I feeling like the connection between these two projects has definitely that human.

226
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:14,070
Megan Young: Experience the human exploration yeah exploration and the.

227
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:19,620
Megan Young: to sort of phenomenology as i'm.

228
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:52,170
Megan Young: touch actually I mean I know i'm talking about distance and but that physicality of each other nests and of experience it's the mushy stuff that's where i'm going with that.

229
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,580
Garrett Laroy Johnson: agree.

230
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,590
Megan Young: And it's also.

231
00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:03,600
Megan Young: The top is green because I didn't yeah but then I open inside and there's a surprise it's like.

232
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,940
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Oh, oh oh.

233
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,980
Megan Young: there's mystery.

234
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,810
Garrett Laroy Johnson: hybrid yeah.

235
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,580
Garrett Laroy Johnson: love it.

236
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:18,900
Megan Young: Alright, so this is going to be something connections between and I don't actually know what I mean I mentioned stuff but.

237
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:28,350
Megan Young: Touching touching surfaces surfaces of public space touching through fear touching like in my project through.

238
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:35,520
Megan Young: projection like our projections of each other of what a situation reads like.

239
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,720
Megan Young: um.

240
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,710
Megan Young: I guess there's some level of response in both work in terms of.

241
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,780
Megan Young: As we're looking at these assumptions and categorization is across.

242
00:26:48,780 --> 00:27:05,610
Megan Young: formats like what is our response to them and their project was incredibly personal and my I guess was presented as being public and maybe somewhat global if not national, but I think isn't incredibly personal.

243
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:13,530
Megan Young: And even maybe both of these projects, realizing that.

244
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:18,960
Megan Young: There is no universal and these choices and and these experiences of.

245
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:27,330
Megan Young: Experience and so like they're both kind of archiving experience and how experiences can be.

246
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:33,420
Megan Young: acknowledged as valid without.

247
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:48,960
Megan Young: i'll say at least without immediate dismissal, but with okay so acknowledging these experiences these individual responses on archiving them, I feel like we both have a strong connection to that archiving practice, but then.

248
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,350
Megan Young: yeah there's almost scientific element of like.

249
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:56,760
Garrett Laroy Johnson: A press wrong button sorry.

250
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,830
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I meant to say.

251
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:04,680
Megan Young: Oh, thank you cool to me meditate my materials balancing it'll take long to put my property.

252
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,240
um.

253
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,360
Megan Young: yeah like a little bit of scientific method.

254
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,720
Megan Young: In a maybe the colonial way, but like.

255
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,550
Megan Young: What.

256
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:21,390
Megan Young: What is the thesis in these experiments and what is what are some of the findings and what are.

257
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:31,620
Megan Young: What are some of the outliers so that's a lot but i'm putting squishy stuff in between us, they look like worms.

258
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:41,550
Megan Young: And they also you know, like the string theory all these threads across time and place and.

259
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:51,030
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Thank you megan yeah you're welcome to to take a couple seconds to finish up with some time.

260
00:28:51,030 --> 00:29:00,660
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, great so i'm going to ask you to well, first of all thank you oh wow this.

261
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,400
Garrett Laroy Johnson: This is great, we have.

262
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,690
Megan Young: They are.

263
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:07,830
Garrett Laroy Johnson: it's all laid out I love this I love this is laid out.

264
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,120
Megan Young: Very theatrical.

265
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,380
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Yes, so in that sense.

266
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:23,340
Garrett Laroy Johnson: In this next section will take five minutes, and we will cut to a different scene, you have a change of scenery.

267
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,360
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And what i'm going to ask you to do in five minutes.

268
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:35,250
Garrett Laroy Johnson: is to create three products based on what i've just posted in the chat.

269
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:53,940
Garrett Laroy Johnson: These are transmissions from a previous interview me they've been transmitted through me and I transmit them now to you and in five minutes and your task is to create some props for them, they are ball on past self heal.

270
00:29:53,940 --> 00:30:16,800
Garrett Laroy Johnson: tendril of young plants and then the third one has two titles one introduction frame to the muppet TV show where all the muppets have their own Square and the muppets are coming out of the squares or a series of stages place each alongside each other in a grid.

271
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,610
Megan Young: Okay, any questions.

272
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:20,430
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Questions about that.

273
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:24,570
Megan Young: No it's just a lot.

274
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:31,020
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So i'll set the timer for five minutes if you want, I can give you kind of like.

275
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:35,220
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I can cut this into three give you give you time for that now.

276
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,740
Megan Young: Okay, I think I have accomplished ball and pass Celsius break.

277
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,080
Garrett Laroy Johnson: i'll hit play.

278
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:51,330
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah you're welcome to narrate this, but you know, otherwise yeah you're also not go.

279
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:56,160
Megan Young: And do I do we get to know who the transmissions I friend at some point.

280
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,340
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I can tell you there from Alice.

281
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:09,180
Garrett Laroy Johnson: From the Alice lonely from data, who did the online cartographic.

282
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,260
Garrett Laroy Johnson: portal work.

283
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:16,920
Thanks.

284
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,610
Megan Young: And then, are the chances that any of.

285
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,580
Megan Young: My conversations will be transmits to other people.

286
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:33,090
Garrett Laroy Johnson: there's not a chance there's a certainty.

287
00:31:33,090 --> 00:32:00,000
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Oh.

288
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,940
Megan Young: plan is coming together nicely.

289
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,980
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Thanks yeah looks like you have some good materials for that.

290
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,560
Megan Young: Already I already had the mystery a screen.

291
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,140
Yes.

292
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,650
Megan Young: It was the last one that was a little daunting I think.

293
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,050
Megan Young: Sorry, I might pull out some pencil.

294
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:24,060
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah sure yeah welcome to.

295
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:34,080
Megan Young: But i'm sorry i'm going to complete my general give it some shape.

296
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,780
Megan Young: Some joy, especially in winter.

297
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:43,980
Megan Young: Yes, okay.

298
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,500
Megan Young: Has 10 trials.

299
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,380
Megan Young: and

300
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:58,740
Megan Young: yeah muppets okay Okay, we do.

301
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,630
Megan Young: I.

302
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:10,110
Megan Young: had been doing some socio emotional visual arts work with young people and we looked at mondrian last yesterday.

303
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:16,650
Megan Young: So honestly.

304
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,310
Megan Young: What.

305
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:45,180
Garrett Laroy Johnson: mondrian muppets.

306
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:51,300
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Two minutes.

307
00:33:51,300 --> 00:34:06,360
Megan Young: Yes, it's nine there I just can't help but thinking also Hollywood squares.

308
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:12,810
Megan Young: Do these items need to be separate in space when they're presenting.

309
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,190
Garrett Laroy Johnson: When you photographed them.

310
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,510
Megan Young: mm hmm.

311
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,250
No.

312
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,900
Garrett Laroy Johnson: not really no.

313
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:36,480
Megan Young: i'm just wondering if this lives near that ball in the field.

314
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,490
Megan Young: To hear about the potentially fake best squat exhibition in Orlando.

315
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:42,240
Garrett Laroy Johnson: know.

316
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,190
Garrett Laroy Johnson: What is it.

317
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:55,620
Megan Young: There were 25 near times just read an article today, this is what I do with my time there were 25 new quote unquote newly found basketball works um.

318
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:03,600
Megan Young: Oh, it might be fake that effort in the article i'm pretty certain are fake.

319
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,360
Megan Young: But they're being presented at the Orlando museum.

320
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,650
Oh.

321
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,900
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Maybe to commentary on entities.

322
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:17,730
Megan Young: Well that's exactly what I was like and so, then they talk about how you know there's this sort of like listing of how artworks are authenticated and you know, like.

323
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:18,120
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah.

324
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,860
Megan Young: I mentioned the warhol.

325
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:30,630
Megan Young: authentication department was shut down because they in accurately D authenticated a work that was authentic and then they were sued for it.

326
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:36,510
Megan Young: So then, they just won't claim to be able to authenticate anything at all.

327
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,220
Megan Young: Fine yeah um.

328
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,230
yeah.

329
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,250
Garrett Laroy Johnson: wow.

330
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:47,160
Megan Young: yeah so, for whatever reason, your muppets are also do not for me.

331
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,310
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay.

332
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:55,920
Garrett Laroy Johnson: All right, okay that's perfect timing.

333
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:03,030
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Just writing down the authenticated markets really fast.

334
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:07,650
Megan Young: there's nothing worse.

335
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:15,330
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, so we've reached the last section.

336
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:23,130
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You now have all these props so I invite you to take a deep breath survey them.

337
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:27,420
Garrett Laroy Johnson: and take them in as.

338
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:41,850
Garrett Laroy Johnson: A kind of language of vocabulary and that you now might use in order to articulate within 10 minutes.

339
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,160
Garrett Laroy Johnson: A new project.

340
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:54,480
Garrett Laroy Johnson: use these props leverage them in order to bring together a unique constellation of materials of components.

341
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:01,170
Garrett Laroy Johnson: That may maybe maybe allows you to articulate a new research question.

342
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:20,820
Garrett Laroy Johnson: or motivate a new set of artistic experiments and so, in other words, bring these things together as a kind of proposal, so of course you're under no obligation to realize this this.

343
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:25,710
Garrett Laroy Johnson: This project, so it may be, as vast and it's aspirational and see like.

344
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,160
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Questions about that.

345
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,690
Megan Young: i'm playing with the perhaps is allowed.

346
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:44,430
Garrett Laroy Johnson: yeah yeah yeah absolutely you can do you can sort of use now these however you like also don't need to use all of them, some of them, you can set to the side.

347
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:55,620
Garrett Laroy Johnson: But yeah just consider this sort of your raw material for for thinking through you know what another one another project might look like another venture.

348
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,360
Megan Young: And then.

349
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,720
Megan Young: Does it matter if the venture is in.

350
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,870
Megan Young: conversation or individual or.

351
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,920
Garrett Laroy Johnson: can be anything.

352
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,190
Megan Young: Okay, no, I meant like i'm sure I speak on the venture.

353
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:16,980
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Oh right yeah you're going right into to think out loud, as you go.

354
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:26,700
Megan Young: And I was taking the moment where you're describing to articulate some Heads on the worms that are crawling from my project to Nina and so as project.

355
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:40,740
Megan Young: They already had tales, but they needed little pet shapes so they got that and then looking at these materials, while you were saying to propose a new one i'm just i'm so going back to how I has done some pretty stark contrast between like.

356
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:45,870
Megan Young: Organic materials and what is maybe.

357
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:49,320
Megan Young: Intellectual construct or.

358
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,020
Megan Young: it's not even so much mechanical.

359
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:56,010
Megan Young: So i'm like.

360
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,210
Megan Young: mondrian puppets are in.

361
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:57,900
Garrett Laroy Johnson: paper.

362
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:07,680
Megan Young: But I think that was time based and I OK so and I focus on the squares and the grid, rather than the muppets themselves.

363
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:19,320
Megan Young: And so, then I have to grids, I have a muppet grid and my neighborhood grid my epic grid I put really near the.

364
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,830
Megan Young: ball determines.

365
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:25,740
Megan Young: The ball on the pastel field.

366
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:32,400
Megan Young: The ball is taken organic matter, as has the young tendrils.

367
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:40,740
Megan Young: New research projects.

368
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:44,010
Megan Young: I cannot think about some version.

369
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:52,650
Megan Young: of exploration that connects the matrix with the.

370
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:58,590
Megan Young: What was the predictive policing movie.

371
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,760
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Minority Report.

372
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,740
Megan Young: Thank you.

373
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,340
Megan Young: But.

374
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:06,780
Megan Young: i'm so like these notions of how.

375
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,650
Megan Young: Biological matter crosses into.

376
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:32,430
Megan Young: system like network things that aren't aren't even in physical form but you know this like human desire to crawl into the matrix and the matrix ease and and roll around so i'm like Okay, I want to invite Nina and Selma to come roll around in police reports with me.

377
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:40,620
Megan Young: And then we invite other people to do the same and we see what they feel like and we see what.

378
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:53,460
Megan Young: We see what's inside there that isn't being shown in these box frameworks that gets spit out after they're cleaned up oh i've also started talking a lot about fuzzy data which.

379
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:59,520
Megan Young: Outside the sciences, is just a really humorous term.

380
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:06,360
Megan Young: But inside the sciences is really humorous term um I have all these fuzzy.

381
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,190
Megan Young: metal.

382
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:12,660
Megan Young: frameworks so yeah okay i'm inviting.

383
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:19,800
Megan Young: Those project leaders and then participants to crawl around inside.

384
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:25,170
Megan Young: A matrix of our own device that'd be fun.

385
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:30,690
Megan Young: I didn't move my props around very much.

386
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:37,290
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Yes, no problem.

387
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:43,590
Megan Young: And i'm going to say is not performance based this is experiential so like maybe it's more like fun house based.

388
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:46,980
Megan Young: Maybe we take tours.

389
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:57,780
Megan Young: You know, like we bring people in through tours it's like oh here's Hong kong's predictive policing matrix what does that feel like tasty.

390
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:01,230
Megan Young: And then until London.

391
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:07,620
Megan Young: And i'm picturing bodies like rolling around and crawling through like the threads of.

392
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:12,420
Megan Young: Data as if they were physical form.

393
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:17,760
Megan Young: This is my research proposal.

394
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,840
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Anything else you wanna you want to add.

395
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:31,470
Megan Young: You are invited.

396
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:36,660
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Thank you megan your.

397
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:41,520
Garrett Laroy Johnson: frontal lobe activities is now over.

398
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,210
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Thank you so much as a super rich.

399
00:42:45,210 --> 00:43:05,280
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So the very last thing I see things we need to do our first of all, you get to pass on some props to tenby you get to know who it is we tell you who it is I tell you this to 10 be who is part of the you okay remember the sounding body.

400
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,160
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Corporate Soros.

401
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:14,070
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You can choose three you can name them, however, you like.

402
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:19,170
Megan Young: Oh no I thought you were gonna pick them okay.

403
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,010
Garrett Laroy Johnson: um.

404
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:24,390
I think.

405
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:29,130
Megan Young: I mean do frantic eating muppets may be one.

406
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:30,990
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, or.

407
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:32,700
Megan Young: hated hmm.

408
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,170
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Is that one.

409
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:38,190
Megan Young: Well, are these supposed to be props or phrases what a fantastic.

410
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:40,830
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So they will be phrases that then.

411
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:46,410
Megan Young: The names of crops okay yeah D authenticated muppets for sure.

412
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:58,200
Megan Young: um.

413
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:03,030
Megan Young: finger smash cookies.

414
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:13,110
Megan Young: would be the next.

415
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:18,900
Megan Young: mondrian maps.

416
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,470
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Okay, thanks megan.

417
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:29,640
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So yeah that's it, that is a wrap, with the exception, taking the photos.

418
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,200
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So i'm going to get this form.

419
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:46,530
Garrett Laroy Johnson: And you should be able to, and if you can't you can always just email me and you should be able to submit the photos there if there's a problem just.

420
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:50,400
email them to me that's fine.

421
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,610
Garrett Laroy Johnson: and

422
00:44:53,610 --> 00:45:00,600
Garrett Laroy Johnson: The last thing is making sure you get your money.

423
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:12,360
Megan Young: And so I had asked and I wanted to save to the end, to ask again, but can I designate the $25 as a donation to a different organization.

424
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,840
Garrett Laroy Johnson: You absolutely can.

425
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,900
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I don't I would sort of.

426
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:25,170
Garrett Laroy Johnson: want me because I have to now like, though, and report this back to asu because I got a grant for this and, like.

427
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:33,570
Garrett Laroy Johnson: It can I give it to you, and then you go and do that or is that too, or you don't want to like you don't want to pass through you, because.

428
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,850
Garrett Laroy Johnson: I get it for tax reasons or something.

429
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:48,600
Megan Young: it's not gonna do anything to my taxes, I, I will be happy to do that, please just note, for your own self and I was gonna say Are you familiar in Chicago either with Assad has daughters or a long walk home.

430
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,630
Garrett Laroy Johnson: saw his daughter sounds.

431
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,730
Garrett Laroy Johnson: So those were the two.

432
00:45:53,730 --> 00:46:00,810
Megan Young: Organizations that I was looking at in Chicago.

433
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:07,200
Megan Young: Otherwise, maybe like links Hall, because they have supported a lot of my work as well, but that's a really different.

434
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,060
Megan Young: type of work.

435
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,530
Megan Young: Anyway, I just wanted you to know i'm.

436
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:13,470
Megan Young: i'll be donating it to one of those three.

437
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,720
Megan Young: friends, I welcome that.

438
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:20,850
Garrett Laroy Johnson: Preference sure actually you know what I mean.

439
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:32,384
Garrett Laroy Johnson: i'm still i'm still working with asu exactly how i'm going to get this money from them, if you want it, maybe i'm not sure exactly what's going on.
